Sorry to keep you waiting complicated. Thank you very much. Iâ€™ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton she congratulated us. It's about us on our victory and I congratulated her and her family on a very very hard-fought campaign. I mean she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation. I say it is time for us to come together as one United people style. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all Americans. And this is so important to me for those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country as I've said from the beginning. Ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. it's a movement comprised of Americans from all races religions backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people. We will work together. We will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single America will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. Their forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer
