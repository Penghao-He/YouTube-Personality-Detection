My name is XXXX and I haven't made a video in a while. I know what you guys are all saying, it's XXXX, where have you been? Yeah -- yeah -- yeah. 
I know a lot of you are like, XXXX, you're a trolling dog, and I'm like, I'm not trolling. I'm just tired lately. I didn't want to make a video but now I'm gonna get back into videos. 
And I'm gonna start doing like a little newscast. It's gonna be really, really awesome. 
So recently on the YouTube I saw Chris Brown. He was like, I'm sorry I never told you guys I was sorry about Rihanna. Well it's kind of late for that, Chris, to have fizzled dog brown. I mean homie, come on, nobody believes that. It looks like you were scripted like this show. Come on my homie Chris Brown, nobody believes you. It was so scripted and you were just staring at the screen like, uh, I don't care, I'm just doing this because I have to. I want us to see an apology kind of like this. 
Hey, what's up guys? My name's Chris Brown and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about what I did to Rihanna, and I was just hoping for you guys to forgive me. 
That's what I want right there. I want an apology like that. I don't want a scripted ten minute thing. I just want something quick, fast and easy. But that's just my opinion on Chris Brown. 
Comment in the comment box on what you guys are thinking. 
So this concludes my video and maybe I'll start making videos every day, maybe not, I don't know, so. 
Peace out.
