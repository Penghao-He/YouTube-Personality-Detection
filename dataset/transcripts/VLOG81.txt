Do you ever feel like Frazier Crane is inside of your house? Frazier Crane, he's inside of my house. He's inside of my house. He's in my head. I love him more than Dr. Phil. He's my favorite psychiatrist. I feel I can have him every night. Whooooo, I love me some Frazier Crane. Woooo Hoo Hoo. 
I think he's in here. I think he coming to get me -- man that Frazier Crane. He's a crazy one, that Frazier Crane. He would just sneak up in your house and he would just come in your room and he would just hide in your closet. You reach in there to get your favorite pants and baaaaah he's got you!
