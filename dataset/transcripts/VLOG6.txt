Hello, and welcome to the XXXX. My name's XXXX and the following is written by David Thorney, Thorney, ney, nei, Tho -- Thoreau, Thor, Thor -- I don't know if the E is silent. 
Welcome to the XXXX, where we XXXX report. 
Obviously, having your own monkey would be a fantastic idea, because they're quite intelligent and yet unable to speak. They have the advantage of learning quickly through beatings while being unable to tell anyone. Below, is a list of the kind of monkeys that would be good to have. The list is far from complete as it omits Jet Ski Monkey, Boiling Water Monkey, Battlestar Galactica Monkey, but covers the basic best kind of monkey there is, Disguise Monkey, monkey that wears a disguise. 
If I had a monkey, I would borrow my mom's sewing machine and make my monkey a little monkey suit. Then if anyone said that's not a real monkey, it's just a monkey suit, I can see the zipper, I could say, I bet you fifty dollars it's a real monkey. And when they say that seems like unreasonable, but you're on, my monkey would take off the monkey suit, and they would have to pay me fifty dollars, and I would buy drugs with the fifty dollars, for the monkey so that he could live with himself for having to live inside a monkey suit all day. 
Gambling Monkey, monkey that likes to gamble. If I had a monkey, I would teach him how to count cards like Dusting Hoffman in Rain Man, and sneak my monkey into a casino. And if anyone said, that's a monkey, whose monkey is that, I would say that is not my monkey. 
 Channel changing Monkey, monkey that changes channels. If I had a monkey, I would teach how to use all of the entertainment equipment. I would save money on batteries for the remote controls by having my monkey change the channels for me. With the money I'd save on batteries, I would buy drugs. I would share the drugs with my monkey, while we watched Black Books and Stephen Chow movies. 
 Surveillance Monkey, monkey surveils. If I had a monkey, I would teach him to track down people who annoy me, by using their profile photo and Google maps. Using an earpiece to communicate, I would have my monkey conceal himself behind the person typing on Facebook. And when that person wrote something stupid, I would have my monkey run up and slap them on the back of the head really hard, and then make a quick escape. Having several monkeys would be more convenient, but I don't have time to train seven monkeys, with having to do my own hair in the morning and all. 
 Web monkey, monkey on the web. If I had a monkey, I would teach it download porn for me. This way I could spend my time watching it instead of looking for it. I estimated this would save me a hundred and thirty seven hours a week. I would obviously require a monkey with similar taste for mine, but how hard can it be to find a monkey with a fondness for pregnant German women, in latex. 
 Monkey monkey, monkey monkey monkey. That's my monkey. 
Final summation, having a monkey sounds like a lot of fun. In the comments below, what would you train your monkey to do? I bet it's dirty, o ho, o ho. The best comments are going to make it onto the next show. 
And I love you, have a wonderful day. Muah. Kisses to your mom, because she knows you know that I know that we know what we both might not know. Lord.
