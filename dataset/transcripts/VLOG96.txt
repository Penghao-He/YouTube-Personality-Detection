Hello, it's, um, XXXX, and it's four twenty a. m. -- that just proves how significant I feel that this little audition is for five legit bloggers -- bloggers distinct -- five legit bloggers. Well, like I said my name's XXXX. I have, uh, the aluminum MacBook and I use iMovie HD, iMovie o nine and, um, sometimes Final Cut Pro to edit. I -- to film, right now I'm using my PhotoBooth from my iSight and sometimes I also use my Sony camera -- which films in HD, by the way. And I would like either Tuesday or Thursday, but XXXX wants Tuesday so I'm gonna say Thursday -- but not Wednesday, because I go to church that night, so yeah. Okay, well I think it would be pretty cool if you picked me. Yeah.
