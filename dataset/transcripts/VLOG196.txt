Let me know, do I still have time to grow, they say no, say it ain't so. Let me know, let me know. Let me sing like street lights glowing, happen to reach just like moments passing in front of me so I have to sing to Kevin. I see myself. See, I know my destination, but I'm just not there in the street.
