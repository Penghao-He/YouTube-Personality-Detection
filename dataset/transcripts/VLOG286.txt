You're probably starting this video thinking, who is this guy? What's he doing on this channel? He doesn't belong here, especially because his voice isn't sped up. This is a place of sped up voices. You , that's what we're here for, that's what we're here to see. Guess what? I'm not XXXX. I know, shocking resemblance but not, not XXXX. Also my hair is not the right color or look at all. Really everything about me doesn't look like him but whatever. I am here to tell you that I have information for you, information about XXXX. He did an interview with me, me baby. You know, because I know a lot of you are always asking questions in the comments. You know, hey XXXX where do you live? Hey XXXX, what's your phone number? Hey XXXX, I wanna stalk you. Hey XXXX, I wanna stalk you. You know, and, uh, the video, it actually answers a lot of those questions. You know like: A) His name's XXXX, it's in there. B) His name's XXXX. I think he says, there's something about ninjas in there, he likes ninjas, but he also likes pirates. He wants to combine them or something, I don't know, whatever. There's actually sixty minutes of interview minutes that I had to cut down into about twenty minutes, uh, two parts segment of this interview, and, uh, so it's very chopped up, question answer, question answer. But it should be pretty entertaining and for you guys who are looking at the first half going, eh this is kind of boring, check out the second half of the video. Its actually -- I find most of the jokes are probably in the second half. Check it out, links in the side bar, great interview, brought to you by anti work . He gives all kind of information, you know, his social insurance number, his email address, his phone number, you know. The exact address of where he lives, uh, his Facebook account, his MS -- no, his, uh, his MySpace, his pager number, uh, his cell phone number, his house number, his Xbox live gamer tag. Everything you want to know about him is in this interview, but not really.
