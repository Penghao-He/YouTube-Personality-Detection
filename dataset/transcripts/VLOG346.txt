Greetings YouTube, XXXX here. Cheers. I gotta show this to you, because it's by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. Ah, oh my God! I -- as you'll be -- as you're aware, I uploaded my commentary to movie Twilight. Now, it got DMCA. I understand why, so I uploaded it as a torrent. First torrent ever and I asked, you know, as I'm dicking around with the thing; I left a comment, is this thing working? And, ah, this is what I got as one of my responses. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Oh, my God! How obsessed are you with me? Eh, oh sweet fuck! You need help Kevin, you need serious fucking help. XXXX, cheers.
