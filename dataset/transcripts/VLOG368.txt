Hi. Um, so I kind of have some bad news that our channel is going to be put on hiatus for now because not very many people are able to blog. Um, yeah, I don't know if or when or if we'll ever, you know, conjoin back together again -- I don't even know if we're technically on hiatus or not. 
I know I would still like to blog, and XXXX and XXXX might still be able to -- or like, willing to blog and stuff, so I'm not sure if that's all gonna continue or if we're gonna -- I don't think we're gonna start a new channel, but we might. 
And, I don't know. XXXX and XXXX, I miss you guys. Even though I still talk to you all the time, I just, I miss you. I miss your videos. And XXXX, if you're watching, I miss you too. 
So, okay, guess that's all for now. I think, I still might continue to make a video on here, just to say hey, what's up, you know, and all that stuff. So, I'm gonna try to keep it beating, the heart of our channel I mean, for now. 
Maybe it's like Frankenstein -- we'll make it come to life again later, woo. Anyway, I'm gonna go now. 
Huh, okay, bye guys.
