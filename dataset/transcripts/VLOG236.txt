Hey everybody. Op, let me, ah. Hey everybody, its XXXX. Grab yourself a piping hot, ice cold glass of Coca Cola for this fireside chat. Oh my gosh, that's so good. Hah, man that's good. Ice cold Coke in our house is the best. Um, we think so. Although we've been off Coke for -- we were off Coke in the house for months, months, months, months. We were only having, like, Kool Aid and water and stuff like that but it's a --
Now the cake's done. Okay the timer stopped. I all ready took it out. I made a cake. Actually I didn't make a cake. I poured it out of the box and mixed it up and put it into a pan. Let's go get it. Let me go get it for you. This chair is so rolly. Look at that. It's covered in cinnamon and, um, it's a cinnamon swirl quick bread. It's got layers of cinnamon in the middle. I think it's going to be good. It's really hot right now. 
Okay, sorry for that interruption. Um, a couple things going on, today we went to the grocery store. So, we go to different grocery stores depending what's on sale and what we need and so forth. 
The dog is over in the living room. She takes her toys and then she throws them in the air and chases after them, like, she plays catch with herself. Which is good, it entertains herself but, um, I think she thinks someone else is throwing it and it's her doing it. She's like, oh, they threw it this way this time. I'll go get it. It's funny. She knows I'm talking about, too. I can tell. 
Um, anyway, a couple things. Ah, I probably all ready started to talk about -- here comes Darla. Here she goes right through the video. Good job, good job. She's got one of those Hawaiian bread rolls, Hawaiian sweet bread, yeah. Do they even have Hawaiian sweet bread in Hawaii? Or is that just something that's got us mainlanders hooked on thinking it's like some special treat from Hawaii when really it's made in Slabtown, North Carolina. 
Anyway, let me tell -- I know what I was telling you, we went to the grocery store today. We go to different grocery stores based on what we need, what the sales are and so forth. Well tonight, um, we went to Aldi. I don't know if -- probably not all of you have Aldi. I'm not sure. Aldi is like a German or Belgian company, I'm not -- I think it's German. Um, and they like open up these grocery stores here and they're like non frills. No frills at all. Um, they've got their system. They are not going to waver from it. Ah, they don't provide bags free of charge. They don't, um -- you have to put a quarter in the shopping cart or as they call them here in the south, put a quarter in the buggy. You have to put a quarter in the buggy to, ah, release it. Ah, and the reason they do that is so that you will return that cart to the corral to get your quarter back. It has, like, this mechanism to get your quarter back out. 
Um, they don't have a lot of people working there. When they scan your groceries, they just scan them and throw them into the cart, and then you bag them yourself. It's this whole -- but they have got the whole system. It's good for certain things. Some things we don't like but as it turns out our next door neighbor is the store manager for our -- the Aldi that's close to us. Um, which is funny because he always comes over and we joke with him about this. He will come over, like, ten o'clock at night and be like, do you guys have an egg? Or do you have a cup of milk? What was he here for the other night? Do you have any cooking spray? Don't they have that at the grocery store were you just spent sixteen straight hours? It just always cracks us up because, you know, that's like me coming home from work and calling my neighbor and saying, do you have a piece of copy paper? 
 So, anyway, today I thought it was funny. One of the things that caught my eye in the grocery store was bacon. We don't buy bacon all the time but it is one of my favorite things. So, today, um, I was comparing the prices, looking at the weight. You know, I compare how much is it per, ah -- per ounce and I do all of that when I grocery shop just because, you know, sometimes it's deceiving. If you've got -- bacon is pretty much all the same, I thought until today. Now, I know better. Um, but you know you've got your hickory smoked, you've got your thick sliced, you've got your, uh, maple cured. Huh? 
Brown maple cured. 
Yeah, cured -- all these different kinds. Well, I found a new kind today, yep. The economy has finally taken a toll on the bacon industry. This is the bacon I ended up with. See if you can see this. It's economy sliced. It's economy sliced bacon. Which from what I can tell -- I haven't opened it yet, but what I can tell is that it's sliced super duper thin. It's economy sliced. 
Well, I didn't even see the economy sliced thing until I got home. Um, but it's a pound, uh, which is interesting because bacon lately has been twelve ounces, it seems like. And this is a whole pound of bacon and it was under two dollars; I'm pretty sure. Like, maybe it was two point two four. I don't know; pretty good price. When we get it on sale you can get it for like two for four dollars, but then it's like twelve ounces. But this is a whole pound. Um, but it's economy sliced. It's economy sliced. Never -- never heard of that. Um, I guess they're just using any old -- any old economy related word they can to hock their product. It's economy sliced. 
Oh, something else new about me. I like jazz music now. I'm a jazz connoisseur. Well, not exactly, but I have one CD. We were in Barnes and Noble yesterday -- yesterday? Yeah, yesterday and, um, I said, I like jazz now. I want to buy a jazz CD. The very first one in my life and I owned hundreds of CDs. So, I got this, Paul Hardcastle The Collection. And I got it because it was the first one that I put in and listen to on the, ah, Barnes and Noble -- you know you can scan any CD in the music section and hear what's on it. Well it was the first one that I scanned and I thought, that sounds like jazz. I like it; I bought it. Um, so that's what plays in my car now. Um, until I get tired of that. 
Um, what else? And, um, maybe that's it? I'm, uh -- I'm trying to blog more, can you tell? Ah, the cake, the bacon, the jazz. I worked today a little bit. That was all. Okay, I'm going to let you go; keep this shorter than it was and I'll to try to edit some stuff out to make it even shorter. Um, just to let you know its seven minutes and forty three seconds, so when you watch this edited video, you see how much I cut out. I don't know yet. Okay, peace out, Westside and Vogue. Um, you know Madonna, um, started the whole Vogue thing. How it made its way into my videos, I don't know. Um, I don't particularly like that song. Um, I -- I don't know how that Vogue thing started, um, but now I'm thinking, um, I'm going to pick up something new like that peace out, Westside and, I don't know. I'm gonna -- give me a suggestion, okay. 
Lady Ga Ga. 
Lady Ga Ga. Okay, 'cause I'll need about, you know, a spackle and a gallon of makeup. All right, bye. It's economy sliced. It's economy sliced. 
And it was on the left and I just reached over and grabbed it and then I just remember --
Yup, it was a dollar eighty nine.
