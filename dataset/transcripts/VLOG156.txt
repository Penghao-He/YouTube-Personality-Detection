Do I think it's gonna be great? Absolutely. 
Let's get on with the music. It's a project that, uh, me and my man XXXX are putting together and, um, he produced the entire thing. It's about -- about sixteen records on there. We started working on it in January, so it's been about -- about eight months -- roughly eight months, but, you know, we just felt that, you know, we wanted to take a little longer on it, you know what I'm saying, because we wanted it to be spectacular. 
As far as, um, guest features on the project; we got my man XXXX, Arizona. Got a record called, Don't Want to Lose Your Love. And got my man,XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the XXXX, my home girl, XXXX, lovely XXXX, out of Phoenix, Arizona as well. And my man, DJ XXXX; No XXXX my DJ. Uh, he did a couple of cuts on the project, you know what I'm saying, so my man, XXXX, the XXXX, you know what I'm saying? We got a record called the XXXX. 
As far as the release date, you know, we're shooting for November of o nine. I will be having a listening party soon, you know what I mean; just to give people a vibe for it and everything. You know, I leaked a few records, you know what I'm saying, nowadays it's like you gotta leak, you know what I mean. It's all about leaking joints. 
We put two hundred percent into a project. It definitely reflects on the material and it shows. And that's how I feel with this project. You know, we really went all in and, you know. You just gotta hear it, that's all I have to say, you just gotta hear it. Let's get on with the music. I am Mr. XXXX and that's what it is, y'all. Peace. 
 Moved on. Bags packed, ready to roll. I moved on. Honey, get the show on the road. I moved on. Even though we had that chemistry, a real fun time, now considered a memory.
