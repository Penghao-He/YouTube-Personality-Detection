Hi, what's up? Um, today I went to school and um, um, I was late for my first class because, um, it was really hard for me to get up 'cause it's a Friday. Thank God it's Friday! Um, I didn't have, um, Business Mathematics class because there was a party going on -- a Christmas party thingy going on at school and then I attended my six to nine class but it was only for an hour and I was so psyched because um, um, so everyone were passing their um, term paper and I've already passed mine two weeks ago. But I was lacking footnotes and research -- I -- I mean, and references but um, like he didn't return it, he didn't return mine. And so after he discussed, um, how to make term papers and he ended the class, I went to him and asked if I could get it and stuff and -- he's an ambassador so it was pretty, like, um, scary to ask and he was really, like, terror ish so. But uh, it was really cool that he knows me. He called me by my name and he said that I should just do good in my final exams and that um, my uh, term paper was okay and that's really awesome, so yeah. Um, yeah, that really psyched me and I'm really happy about that. 
After that I went to, um, I went to, um, a bazaar in -- in the city -- in -- yeah, in the city -- with -- with my best friend and -- and his mom. So it's pretty cool. Anyway, I got to shower and head to bed because, um, my friend's celebrating her eighteenth debut -- I mean her eighteenth birthday -- her debut tomorrow. 
So, yeah. Later, bye.
