Okay guys, uh, this is going to be a three part video. Okay, part one. Okay, there's three parts. This is going to be three important parts and the first part is famous quotes and my quotes. One I'm pretty sure you've all heard. I love this one because we'd do anything for love and if it's horrible, you know, all is fair in love and war. I'm not sure who said it. I didn't research anything he said, um yeah, because most of them were mine and some of them --
Okay, number two, keep your friends close and your enemies closer. I like that one, except like one of my worst enemies is now like one of my closest friends and seriously my best friend. And not even close to being my enemy any more. 
Um, three -- by the way this part is going to be short, time is a valuable thing and don't waste it. Okay? 'Cause, um, it's time. You can't stop time and it's a valuable thing. 
Four, never take life for granted, it can end at any mo -- or moment. Like right now, you could be driving a car and maybe you're on your laptop -- bam, your dead -- car accident. Life can end at any moment. Never take it for granted. 
Number five, one of my friends said this. I -- I'm not truly believing in it though, so mean you might, um -- you die -- you die inside when love dies. I'm not in to that, yep. 
Six, ah, this -- this is one that's kinda short. Never stop believing in whatever you believe in. Don't have someone discourage you from believing in it. Christians, believe in Lent or whatever. Like, today at school we were eating chocolate chip cookies and one of my friends gave up, um, chocolate for Lent and I'm like, are you serious? So he had to pick out the chocolate pieces. That really sucked. 
 And seven, we all make mistakes. All of us -- all of us have it and we all do. There's not one perfect person out there who has not made a mistake. Remember that, not even one. You might think that you're perfect, but you're not. And life is unfair. It is. Get over it. It's unfair. Trust me. I used to think life was fair but it's not. Life is unfair and get over it. Stop being a baby and get over it. Life's unfair. I don't care how young you are, you need to learn that life's unfair. And you need to learn now. 
Okay, part two. Put this on paper so that I'd actually be able to remember. Okay, we are going to talk about Paper Towns. It was a fantastic book. I read it because one of my friends, XXXX, XXXX, um, XXXX, he -- XXXX said to call him XXXX -- he recommended it to me, off YouTube. He's one of my friends on here and he's a big YouTuber guy, blogger. And I told him this video's about Paper Towns and we're talking back and forth and he said, really I finished it in a day. It was awesome. It was a fantastic book. 
Huh Margo, huh Margo, Margo Roth, Roth Spiegelman. It really does get stuck because they always say Margo Roth Spiegelman and they never just say Margo. Well you -- sometimes they do. Also, you know Radar how his parents own a black santa thing -- even though if none of you have read it; you really need to read it. It's a fantastic book. And, oh yeah, you know the place Radar always gets on omnictionary? It's real. I typed it in at home and I then I'm, like, I wonder if it's real, www dot omnictionary dot com, and it's real. It talks about Margo, I think Margo's real. I'm not sure. I don't really care right now -- and it's real. And it's really interesting and I like it. So, I made an account and -- it's a fantastic book I think that all of you should read it. Yeah, and hey Shainalicious I hope you watch this video -- video because, thank you. It's a great book. I have been talking to him messages about that. 
Part three, probably the second best part, maybe the first best part for some of you. Okay, we all remember the Joe from nineteen ninety three and how he looked and he said that he was going to create a new account, right? Yeah, guess what? I found his new account and I know it's him. So, I will have a link in it. And I'll have a link in the side bar for XXXX and the -- his account, his new account, um, it's called XXXX, he's not eighteen now, and you can tell just by watching some of the videos, it's him. And it's him and it's really awesome. 
 One of his rules is don't talk about him but, hey, I know you guys have been wondering so bad, so, uh -- so he won't be happy, so he -- might be mad that he-- that I found it that -- he felt that he actually did create a new account and I found it. So, I hope that you guys enjoy this. Watch this video and subscribe. Uh, go to the sidebar and subscribe to XXXX. Subscribe to XXXX or just go look at their account. Yeah? Just do that for me. You don't even have to subscribe to me but I'd be happy if you did. Yeah so, well, might be it. Let's check. That's part three out of three, so that's it, so it's XXXX signing off. That's my signature now, peace.
