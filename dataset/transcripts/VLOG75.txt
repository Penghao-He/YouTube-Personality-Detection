Hello. Um, my name is XXXX and I live in Michigan. I'm nineteen years old and I'm new to YouTube. I've made a makeshift tripod with practically every book I own. Plus a shoe box. I, like, I don't know. It's probably going to fall over. 
Let's talk about what I like because I like things. I like Harry Potter -- a lot, actually. Like, if you look up here, there's a Harry Potter poster. Ron was . I really like Wren . And I do love a lot of musicals, but I'm not very, like, knowledgeable on musicals. I just know that I like a couple of them, and I enjoy them. I'm always open to new suggestions, like musicals. 
I like a good book. All of the books in here are practically the Twilight series and Harry Potter. Don't -- don't hate me for liking the Twilight series, please. I like it. I don't care if you don't. I mean, we can still be friends. I know people who hate it. 
And then I also got some, uh, I don't know -- I got Possible Side Effects, by the author who wrote, um, Running With Scissors. And The Da Vinci Code, which I never actually read. 
I'm a big, big, big shopaholic. Ooh, my phone just vibrated. I'm a big shopaholic, um -- . There it goes. 
You want to see my closet? I mean, there's not much in there. But there's a lot over there. See that -- that hamper? Yeah. That's all my clothes. Behind me is my door. 
Um, and I do love -- now you can't see it. But I really like photography -- especially fashion photography. That's what I hope to go into someday, but you know -- I always got a dream, but when is it really ever going to happen, right? 
What do I do on YouTube? I watch people such as The FiveAwesomeGays, the FiveAwesomeGirls. Um, I watch, uh -- I definitely watch The Blog Brothers. They are my favorite. I'm quite the Nerdfighter. I even made a shirt; let -- let's see if I can find it. Button it. 
I was there in Grand Rapids when they had the impromptu Nerdfighter gathering, and I thought, oh no, like ten people would show up, and almost a hundred people did. I was there. 
If you're wanting to get to know me, you can just message me, or you can comment. There's, like, three comments, so I'll definitely read that and respond to you. Um, you can follow me on Twitter. It -- my name is the same on Twitter, as it is on YouTube: XXXX. Or -- even on dailybooth dot com. I really like that website now, so it's the same on there too. 
Uh, you can find me on a lot of websites. I probably got the same , uh, same name for everything. Uh, go ahead and message me on anything if you'd like. 
Uh, it was great, uh, talking to you guys. It was great talking to you guys. 
Um, see you later.
