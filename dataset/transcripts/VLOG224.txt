And don't you think it's really annoying when people apologize, like, over apologize, about not making a video? I'm really the victim, like the viewers. But I -- I -- I always feel like I want to apologize when I don't make a video for a very long time. It's, like, I did vanish, but not really. 
So, I've been doing nothing, in a really good way, I guess. Yeah, in a -- in a really good way, do nothing in a really good, fun -- just making making a video too. Bet you want to see my face, even though my hair covers it anyway. Um, but I've also been wondering what makes somebody shallow? Like, not limited to, like, physical parents, but when you find out someone you're interested in and, like, really into music that you don't like, or an artist you absolutely hate, and that's such a turn off that you're not attracted to that person any more. Is that -- is that considered shallow or something -- something like that? If -- if you like, uh, very, um, deep things, so I guess it is, but I don't know -- what are your thoughts? Please tell me. I can't trick my own thoughts. 
Oh, I got a little bit tanner. Not too much tanner, but a little -- little bit tanner, so it doesn't look like I'm Boo Radley, uh, To Kill A Mockingbird. Sometimes I just like making faces. Like now. 
Hi. I'm just waiting for my camera to change colors. Okay, I think that's it. 
So it's been a really long time. Um, I don't really have an excuse, but I'm just in a frump, really. You can understand that.
