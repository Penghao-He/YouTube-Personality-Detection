Hey. I literally just hung up the phone on my interview for Spring twenty ten and I don't know what to think. Um, normally I really love interviewing. Not love it but I don't mind that part of the process. But phone interviewing where you can't see the other person's face is odd. It was a weird experience for me. 
So she called like three minutes late. I was like sitting on my bed just like staring at my phone from like three twenty exactly, um, because my interview was at three thirty. It lasted exactly half an hour. It would have been shorter and because I almost did not get invited to audition, which I would have cried. We went over my application, we talked about some general -- why do you want to work for Disney? She said I sounded like I had been a couple of times and what my favorite park was. 
If she had to talk more about my favorites, I'd be like, well I love Magic Kingdom but Illuminations is my favorite nighttime spectacular and my favorite ride is Splash Mountain. But in Epcot it -- I don't even know what my favorite in Epcot is. Illumination, um, that's not a ride. Um, and my favorite MGM Hollywood Studios ride is Tower of Terror and in Evil Kingdom, I love Expedition Everest and Kilimanjaro Safari. Then we would have talked for like two hours, so probably for the best though and we talked -- she was like, what's your favorite resort? I was like Pioneering because like my dad likes the art club and he is the one paying. 
She's like, I see you’ve retail experience, would you like to add quick food service, beverage and merchandise? I was like; I felt bad declining to do either. So I was like, I guess merchandise would be okay. She asked me what my role was -- she didn’t ask me my top three. She asked me what I thought I was most qualified for and so I was like, attractions and concierge? Because I -- compared to the other applicants I don't have the super extensive dance and theatre background. I have passion and a bit of a dream. I know a lot of people have their dreams but I just -- it just didn’t jump to me, as I am qualified to do this. I think I am qualified but it was kind of an awkwardly worded question for me. I think I qualify for face. I don't think I qualify face, I'm sorry. Hi poppy. Okay, no that was -- scratch that. 
So I said attractions, because I love public speaking and concierge because I love guest service and I have a pretty extensive knowledge of Walt Disney World. So we talked about merchandise. She asked one question about that. She asked a couple about attractions and how comfortable I am on spieling, which I am very comfortable, as you can tell. We talked about concierge quite a bit, which was really to me because like I said, that's one of my top choices. I was pleasantly surprised about how much we spoke about the concierge seeing that I'm not a hospitality user. 
Um, then she was like, do you have any questions for me? I was like, can I go . She was like, oh you have to be invited to get the [] and I was like, oh, I can totally do this and -- great, I was freaking out that I would not get invited to the utter shine. She was like, just know it's very competitive. I was like, I know I know. I was like, but I was Clifford in Barnes and Noble once and I am getting involved in theatre and please please please invite me. So I guess that worked. I didn’t get to wish her a magical day. I kind of wish I had, um, but on to the audition which I need to rock. 
I don't know guys. I am sorry this blog is so long, I'm just -- my heart is still racing. I'm -- oh wow. I am hoping for concierge or attractions and I am getting really pumped about spring twenty ten. I'm going to be bummed if it doesn’t work out. Bye guys. I'm going to Euro Disney Company, I'm excited. But it's pouring rain again. My hair does not like this weather at all. Hey, bye. 
Some imagination huh?
