Hi, everyone. Um, it's XXXX and this is XXXX. 
Um, last week I did the um, cooking video, so that was week four; I just didn't label it. But anyways, I'm glad, like, a lot of people liked that and, um, I got a couple of messages saying that they've tried it and stuff, and that it was great, and so that's, that's awesome. 
Um, I kind of have some bad news. This week, well today, is Thursday and it's my weighed in day and so, I woke up, went to the bathroom and stepped on the scale and I have gained one pound. Now, I know it's just one pound, but I was really hoping to lose, like two, but I guess in the big scheme of everything, what's one pound? 
Compared to, like, fifty? Not, not a lot, I guess, but still, it's kind of disheartening, but it, it's motivated me, because I do really well. But, like, I do well during the day, I do like, perfect, okay? 
But then, um, at night, I stay up really late and I need to not, because I eat. I get hungry, it's horrible. So, I'll work on that, because I don't want to waste time doing well during the day if I'm going to just ruin it all at night, so I really need to work hard, um, yeah. 
So this morning I decided to make a green smoothie, which I make a lot, okay, but I didn't want to use milk just because I drink too much milk at night. Anyways, so I had some carrot juice left over from some soup that I had made. So I tried to put carrot juice in my shake, um, you know, it just looks like that, just normal. 
Anyways, I'm going to try it, because I don't really know if it will be good, or bad, or what. Um, it's pretty good. I mean, it just tastes like it does with milk, but, like, I guess you get kind of a carrot aftertaste. 
Um, I think it's a great alternative, and way less calories, and uh, lots of vitamin A, so good to that. 
So what went in to the blender was, one banana, a third of a cup of carrot juice, three fourths cup of yoghurt or one like, packet thingy, like five ice cubes, and a handful of spinach. It's pretty good. 
Okay, so I weigh myself a lot. Well, not so much anymore, but I used to. I used to weigh myself like five times, every day. And if you think I'm kidding you, I'm not. 
Um, so I decided to do a little mathematical equation to figure out how much time that really is. So what I did was, I just pretended like I weighed myself once a day, for my whole life, okay? Eighty five years, I'm gonna say is how long I'm gonna live. 
Um, so, if I weighed myself, guessing that it would take one minute to do, every day of my life for eighty five years, I would waste five hundred and seventeen hours. Five hundred seventeen hours; that's such a long time to be just weighing yourself. 
Um, weighing yourself is such a petty thing to do anyways because, I gained one pound this week, but can I tell that I gained one pound this week? No. And, if I had lost one pound, could I tell? Probably not. 
Um, what I should be doing is just measuring my waist once a month, 'cause that is real progress. A number on the scales isn't as important as -- it's not worth those five hundred and seventeen hours. 
So I know that's a little unrealistic, to weigh yourself everyday for 85 years. So I said okay, I'll do this for thirty years. Alright, if you weigh yourself once a day for thirty years, you're wasting a hundred eighty two hours. 
Okay, let's say you're doing it for just ten years. You're dieting for just ten years, and you're weighing yourself everyday, that's sixty hours. That's sixty days that you could be exercising for an hour a day and you could be losing real weight instead of weighing yourself all the time. 
Okay, I weigh myself once a week now, and it's really hard to stay off the scale, because, um, last summer is when I really started wanting to lose weight, and I didn't do it in a healthy way. I restricted my calories, and I didn't eat enough. 
Um, I lost twenty pounds that summer. So I wouldn't say I was like, majorly restricting, but it definitely was not good, at all. So then, by that school year, I'm like, whoa, I need to cool it, you know? I need to eat healthy again. But I didn't, still. 
Now, I started to over eat because, I really don't know why, but I just, I started to eat way too much, so throughout the school year, I gained -- this school year that's over now -- I gained like, 40 pounds back. 
That's like, -- now I have to loose that much just to get to where I was. It's horrible. It's a horrible thing to have to go through, and --
So now I'm eating healthy and I'm loving it. I'm a lot happier. I'm getting my personality back. Um, huh, yeah, and I'm just learning to love life again. 
But I won't ever really be happy with what I weigh, until I weigh -- until I get those forty pounds off, 'cause I just wish I hadn't have done that. Because if I knew what I knew now, I -- I could've lost so much weight, healthy, and I could have kept it off. 
But you know, I'm young, I have a life ahead of me, so I really don't have anything to worry about. Um, yeah
Anyway, sorry this was like, end of a -- I don't know, depressing video, but I'm focusing on getting things better -- I get way too many thumbs up. 
Anyways, um, so, comment, subscribe. 
I will talk to you all next week with a more positive message, I'm determined and, um, goodbye.
