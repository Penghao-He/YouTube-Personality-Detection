It's been -- it's really late, and I should be sleeping but I have nothing better to do. Well, I do, I could study, but I'm not gonna be . I got back from a, um, rock concert at my university. I bought um, Ministry of Magic, and, um, it's in my computer but I bought, um, Butterbeer Experience, Lena, um, her new Beetle the Bard CD of stuff, and uh, rock opera. Yes. Um, yeah, so here're some photos and some footage I took at the concert. 
Really think you'll win. I am your waking nightmare, the chill it chokes your spine. I'll flood your veins with venom, the boy who lived, you will die. Waiting, watching. 
Voldermort, darling, can I fetch you some water? 
Yearning, burning. 
Voldermort, please can I help you with something? 
I am the dark lord. And I am looking for the I am the Dark Lord. . . . 
I feel like I have to preface this next clip. Um, the sounds went out. It kind of threw them off for a second, and then they just went on, without the music, probably my favorite moment of the night, it was pretty incredible. Here's the clip. 
Ohwee. Why does that sound like a munchkin? Now I've got a job to do. Woah, wooh. Now I've got a job to do. 'Cause I'm finally on our own. 
Cause we're finally on our own. 
We've gone away from home
We've gone away from home. 
We'll never be alone. 
Never be alone. 
We've got a place to call our own. 
To call our own. 
Finally on our own. Far Away from home. Never be alone. On our own, in sorrow, in sorrow, in sorrow, in sorrow, in sorrow. 
I think that part was, they were all so excited that it was going to be warm. It was Florida and it was supposed to be warm, but it was freezing. I mean, we were all frozen, like, solid, like I couldn't move my toes because I was so cold. I also wore my converses, which probably weren't exactly the most, uh, insulated shoes. It was pretty fun. Like, everybody was into it, it was good. Even though it was a smaller crowd then they probably expected -- we Floridians are not used to the cold, we cannot handle it -- so, yeah, yeah. 
Yes, there's a chopstick in my hot chocolate. I'm finally done with all of John Solo books. The book before last book was the last one. It was really good. I really enjoyed it. He kind of tells life as it is. I've been, uh, recently amused my t shirt, and, my little, uh, Sonic screwdriver. 
Doesn't make sounds, but it goes nee. Okay, I got problems. It came with my journal of impossible things that I am a crazy fan. Haven't gone through it yet, but I will. Um, what else? That's it. Here's some other random stuff. My dog.
