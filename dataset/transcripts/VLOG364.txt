What's up, internet? XXXX here. So, many of you will have switched to summer time last night, and if you're anything like me, then you'll always spend a little moment thinking, ooh, do I change the clock from two to three, or back from three to two? And there's an interesting little phrase to help you remember that and that's in spring, spring forward and in fall, fall back. And that always helps to remember, you know, when you lose an hour, and when you gain an hour. Although, I still haven't really figured out the use of summertime, whatever, and such a little trick is called a mnemonic, or however you pronounce it. M and an N in a row, I don't know who thought of that. 
There are actually a number of these tricks, floating around, you know, helping you remember stuff. And I find them very useful because I am lazy that way. For example, one of those tricks is, you know, when you screw in, a screw, um, which way do you turn? And, uh, there's a trick, lefty loosey, righty tighty. So, if you look at the top of a screwdriver, turning it to the right will tighten the screw, and turning it to the left will loosen the screw. That's pretty practical. 
If you're ever in a ship or a boat, you'll know that there's no left and right, there's always portside and starboard side, right? But which one is which? Here's another interesting mnemonic phrase to help you out with. Port is always left at sea, but never at dinner. You know, pertaining to port wine. So, if you're facing the front of the boat, port is left side, starboard is the right side. 
Here's another one that I like. When you set up a chess board, right, do you set it up this way, or that way? And, you actually set it up this way, why? Because, white is right. Got it? 
There also used to be this nice phrase to help you remember, you know, the planets in the solar system, as seen from the sun, and that used to be, My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas. You know, with each first letter of a word, pertaining to the first letter of a planet, you know, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and so on, and so forth. Of course, back when I was in school, Pluto was still a planet, and -- I am really starting to show my age there. You know, when I was your age sonny, the solar system actually had one more planet than it does now? Well anyway, so, I don't know if there is a new mnemonic phrase for that. Maybe, like, My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nothing. I don't know. Um, yeah, but, you know, things like that happen and help in real life. You know, I'm not even going to go into all the details of my private phrases, like, you know, stalactites, whatever, but if you have any mnemonic phrases that you'd like to share with the rest of us, please do. Thanks a lot. Bye bye.
