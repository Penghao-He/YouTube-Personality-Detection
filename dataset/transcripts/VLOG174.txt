Welcome to blog number cinco. Number five of XXXX here today, to talk about my new glasses. Uh, this is a topic that may not interest most people, because it's not controversial, um, it's really not very interesting either, so I don't know why it would interest anyone, but this is what um, our board of two panelists decided that I was gonna talk about, so I just do what I'm told. 
Uh, basically what just happened is I went back in time from two thousand nine to nineteen fifty six by putting these glasses on, um, back to the ages when men were men and boys grew up to become men. Unlike today when boys will be boys is the model of our society. It was a proud time, a time of coal mining, hard hitting football players from places that mined coal. Uh, the good old days. I'm sure the Green Bay Packers were good at football, I don't know if Vince Lombardi was coaching, but good times, I really miss it, not that I was there for them. 
What else was happening? Oh, um, well, we must've been in the middle of the Cold War so that must've been kinda exciting, um, in our arms race with the Russians and our race to get to the moon which happened um, nineteen sixty four, something like that. I'm sure that was exciting, and people with glasses just like these, they designed those spaceships, they designed the computer systems. Maybe Neil Armstrong even wore glasses like this when he said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. " I don't know. 
Oh, and by the way, the moon landing was not fake, that's just a bunch of mumbo jumbo. I can't believe that people have the audacity to say that things like the lunar man -- landing and the Holocaust are fake -- never happened. That -- like especially the Holocaust, come on, that's six million people. Six million people massacred or some atrocious amount like that and you're trying to tell them that it didn't happen when they still have relatives today that are alive? Unreal. Can you be any more insensitive to these people? Just make me sick and I wanna throw up all over this web camera right now and just show you how disgusted I am by the fact that you would take away this historic event which -- just hide the atrocities so that we don't have to think about the atrocities of mankind and what they committed. 
 I'm not saying that we should dwell on these, but to forget about them completely is worse than simply sitting around and not doing anything, because you're just gonna let it happen again. Um, because people won't know about it and they'll just become as intolerant and abusive of power as Adolf Hitler was. So as I was saying, got new glasses, hope you enjoy them as much as I do and uh, continue to rock. This is XXXX, vlogging off.
