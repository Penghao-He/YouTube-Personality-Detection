Ah! , hey guys, so I'm glad to say that I'm home in Las Vegas, Nevada, visiting for the weekend. It feels awesome. 
And this is my doggie Lizzy , yeah, yeah Lizzy. She's named after me. Don't -- don't get it too wrong, opp, she cute, opp she's bangs, ah. Okay, so, let's catch you up on the DL. There's -- there's not too much going on, but I'm just excited to me home in Vegas. What are you doing? . 
I'm just so excited. Like, I was driving home and I got here in, like, three hours 'cause I was speeding. I was going, like, eighty five. That is kind of dangerous, in the dark, but I'm about to go to lunch with uh, some friends, Alex and Harrison . I'm excited to see them. And then I'm getting a massage and then, huh, it's -- I should go to my dinner. 
Yeah, she missed me. I missed her. It's been a long fricking time. But anyways I'm happy to be home. I just got to the chiropractor fixed my back because of all of my back problems and what not and then, whoo, she crazy. Crazy bananas. 
But a -- I -- I need to make cooler blogs. I don't know how to make blogs, so if you want to help me out -- I've been, like, researching trying to figure out better ways to make them, but I just, like, maybe I'm not that entertaining or something because I always thought that I was entertaining but then I look at other peoples and it's, like, they're twenty thousand times more entertaining and I got nothing. That's why I only get, like eighty, views. Eighty, that's, like, nothing. 
You guys better watch my videos. Watch my videos and subscribe to that pointy box over there. I think that's right, over there. And um, yes, so much stuff has been going on, it's insane. 
I am just awesome. That's all I have got to say, is that I'm just so awesome. Yeah, so I'm talking to a guy. That's all I'm going to say about that but he's pretty hot. But this weekend is going to be a blast. I'm probably going to blog but I just wanted to say how awesome it is to be home. Awesome, awesome. I say these words and I never stop saying them at all. 
I want to show you guys my room. Pink, there's a lot of pictures on my fitting bag over there, yeah, representing. I've got to do homework this weekend. Not too exciting, ahh. 
You -- so I'm picking up my bike. That's the main reason why I came down here so I could get up my bike and so I could go ride. So if you're in LA downtown and you ride a six gear call me because I need someone to ride with, please. 
All right, I'm going to edit this and put it on YouTube. Yeah, I'm bored. Before lunch, lahhh, we'll see. If you want my mouth, don't you? Don't you? Loo l'loo l'looo, you -- what are you looking at? What are you looking at?
