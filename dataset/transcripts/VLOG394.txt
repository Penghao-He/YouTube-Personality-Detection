I'm going to ask a question, don't expect an answer because nobody really ever answers any of my questions in these stupid things anyways. Ah, I read the story today about the -- ah, ah, four or five Guantanamo, um, uh, detainees that have openly, um, admitted to planning and setting into motion the, um, um, September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center. And in the statement that they released, it essentially -- from the way it's told they bra -- were bragging about the fact that they -- that it was so successful. Um, they were very proud of how successful it was and how it was a gift from them to God. 
Um, the confusion I get is that this is no surprise to me. I mean, the fact that it's a surprise to anyone is -- is more of a surprise to me than these particular detainees saying that. I mean, especially considering they honestly believe their religion and their God is telling them, or maybe not so much literally telling them, but dictates that they are supposed to do these things. That their religion dictates that they're supposed to, um, punish the infidels, which they consider non Muslims to be. Um, they're extremists. That's kind of the thing. You know, extremists do extreme things based on their religious beliefs. It's not a big surprise, but it seems like it's being portrayed as a horrible, awful, ruthless, evil thing that these people are bragging about it. The people, um, extremists of every religion do some freaky ass shit. Christians did it. Muslims do it. I mean, don't know enough about Jews to know if they did -- do it. Um, Buddhists follow Buddha. I mean, starts off being scrawny and skinny, keeping themselves from eating and then turns into, ah, you need to eat, eat, eat, eat and enjoy everything about life, fat Buddha, bald Buddha. Every extremist in every religion does some weird shit. Um, I'm not excusing. Um, I -- I personally do not believe that it is right to uh -- to cause harm or to hurt anyone who has, at best, a vague connection to the government or military which you think you're having a war with and this is where my confusion comes in. 
Um, I don't understand how I can understand the point of view of the terrorists, don't agree with of the -- even the extreme groups such as the Taliban and some of the insurgent groups and why. I can understand some of their motivation, some of the reasoning behind it and I'm sure if I, you know, went and just researched it more, probably interviewed people or whatnot like that, that are involved in these particular situations, I would understand their motivation a lot more. It doesn't mean I would agree with their -- their actions, um, it just means I would understand why. It's sort of like ah, you have a weird brother or sister, for some strange reason whenever they get into a car, ah, they start picking their nose. Um, I'm pretty sure you could probably find why they do that. Ah, ah, it's the same thing. You can find out the reason for everything. You might not agree with the action, but you can understand and find out why did this happen or why did they do this. But nobody it seems in the United States is attempting in any way, shape or form, to do that. I mean, we also see how big a failing that is. One of the biggest problems that we've seen in the Middle East throughout history is the lack of trying to find out, the lack of concern of understanding why or the motivations of Middle Eastern people. Great Britain, when it had, ah, much of the Middle East as it's colonies, um, as -- as under its protection, its control as colonies, they failed because they didn't understand or even bother to understand. Ah, the Russians, ah, huge war in, I think, it's either Iran or Afghanistan, one of those two countries they failed because they didn't bother to try to understand and, um, sadly enough, and a lot of people will get pissed about this, the United States was failing in Iraq for the same reason. We refused to or just didn't have the ability to understand or even try to figure it out, ah, um, the whys and the -- the um, the motivations and actually we currently are being so successful, not because of military might, but from all reports, it's back room deals. Um, discovering motivation and giving them other motivation, ah, making connections that we didn't make before non military things and yes, there are some black offs that go on too, but it's -- it's more based on intelligence and -- and understanding and discovering the answers. The motivation to things then it was military might. Military might got us nowhere. Military might got Great Britain nowhere. Military might got Russia nowhere. I mean, it has gotten no one when it come to the Middle East anywhere, but for some strange reason, in the United States, all we can think of or whenever it comes to terrorists or anybody associated with terrorism or anybody associated with, um, September eleventh and those attacks and what went on like that, um, what we should do is we should do anything that we can to get them to confess to having something to do with any of those certain things, just to keep us safe and not lock them in the legal rights that we have. Um, that we should in any shape or form try to understand any of this to maybe find a way of not -- of preventing something like this from happening again. Instead, it's they're evil, they're awful, you know, these are disgusting, horrible, horrible, evil, people that need to be just blown off the face of the planet. Um, it's not going to work and I just don't understand why -- why so many people refuse to even attempt to understand. I mean, it's like if you try to understand a person's motivation that's done something so horrible as killed three thousand people, it's like you're siding with them. It's like you're trying to excuse it. Ah, I mean that's the way people treat me whenever I ask them, you know, they're not evil they're just stupid, misguided, wrong, you know. It's the act that they did, from our point of view is evil, but they're not evil, they're doing what they think is right, but nobody will -- everyone is convinced that I have spoken to or asked about this, that I'm wrong. I mean, that in saying those things I'm saying what they did was excusable and I personally don't think that killing anyone is excusable. But in any case, it comes down to my question, um, which like I said nobody ever really watches these damn things and if they do, they don't actually answer my questions. 
Um, my question is this. The five or four Guantanamo Bay detainees that have taken, um -- taken responsibility for the, ah, ah, September eleventh attacks of the World Trade Centers and bragged about it and said it was a gift, ah, ah, to God, um. They did this believing that their religion, their God is -- wants them to do it, that this is what they are, um, supposed to do. This is what they are compelled to do based on their religion and I'm not saying that they're right, and their analysis of their religion. I mean, and there will be a lot of conceptions of any one religion, but that's what they believe. They believe that they are compelled to -- they are required to, by their God, by their religion, to perform these acts whether we find them horrible or not. I mean, they feel they have to do them, that this is part of their belief system. Um, so back to my question. The thing is whatever religion you happen to be, if, theoretically, your God, whoever you happen to worship showed up, right in front of you, just showed up and told you, um, or rather asked you to go and, uh, strap a bunch of C four to your waist and blow up everybody who's visiting the Lincoln Memorial Monument. And, um, and in asking why, your God told you because there are people there that are evil and they need to be destroyed, so I need you to go and destroy these people and if you don't do this then these evil people will continue to do some terrible, horrible things that will cause the death of children and women and innocent people, innocent people that you care about, would you go and do it? And then, if you did that, would you be evil for doing it? Because, I hate to say this, but a lot of these extremists, Muslim extremists that are performing these terroristic acts believe their religion and God is compelling them to do this; is asking them or demanding that they do these things. These acts that your God asked you or demanded or whatever your religious beliefs happen to be, for you to do, how would that make you any different than the terrorist. I mean, now we're saying, literally your God is asking or demanding that you do this, and that if you don't these evil people are going to cause harm to people that you care about. How, if you did it, would it be different than them doing it, when them
