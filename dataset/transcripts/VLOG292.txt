Hey everybody, it's October thirtieth, two thousand and nine. I am and I am not a vegetarian, but I probably should be. As you can probably tell from the title I'm presumably going to give this video -- there's probably a title right above my head as you watch this on the internet. 
For a variety of reasons, vegetarianism makes sense. The first thing -- typically the first thing I've read anyway, that vegetarians or vegans -- which is vegetarian plus, you know, they don't even drink milk, which would be hard for me, man. I always drink milk. Milk is cool -- healthy and everything. 
So, the first thing that I typically hear vegetarians bring up is the moral issue. That animals have certain rights. And we shouldn't kill them and eat them and I've always sort of wondered about that. I certainly believe we have to protect the environment, you know. The environment produces all of our air, for instance. And if we pollute the air, we will not have any more air to breathe and the humans will all die. So you know, let's not do that. And a variety of other things. The environment is complicated, I don't like -- you know, you start -- they're cutting the rainforest and stuff and cause all these other things that eventually -- just cause crap for people, you know. So certainly you should respect the natural world in that broad extent. 
Now, how much respect do you give individual animals, though? Particularly if you -- you know, got -- get yourself a whole bunch of cows or whatever that you can produce, sustainably, there would be more cows every new year whatever and you know, more cows are born and stuff and they're replacing the old ones, and there's no particular pollution going on. Though there are separate things with the way we mess with our livestock and jack them up with a whole bunch of hormones and overly high doses of antibiotics even when they're not sick and so forth, which is great for profit margins but not necessarily great for us people that eat all of that and other things that can cause in the long run. There's stuff that's --
I like organic food, myself. I'm not going to eat a whole lot of it, but when I can get it, I like organic. Because it means actual organic and not just they called it organic, 'cause it -- it's complicated. 
Animals individually, when there's no, you know, grand environmental impact, how much rights do they have? It's a thorny issue, you know, um, we don't typically eat dogs -- you ever notice that dogs are like, you know, intelligent and we let dogs as pets and stuff. Wonder if there's some sort of movement where people get cows as pets. Maybe we'd stop eating cows, you know, or pigs or whatever other things you like to pet, it would be kinda weird to eat it -- ish. 
You can get into all sorts of issues as -- it comes down to philosophy. The morality of what constitutes, you know, a thing, a human type thing that needs to be protected. Like is a dog, like, you know, one tenth of a human sort of a thing, you know? They deserve a certain amount of protection. Is a cow like one twentieth of a human in terms of how much moral weight it has? I don't know really. It's complicated -- ah, there's the moral issue here. Hard to say. 
But discarding that entirely, I still ought to be a vegetarian, why? Well, its' healthy. I looked it up. It's actually healthier, you get all your nutrients from vegetables -- what, I'm sorry -- sorry, from non meat products, grains, fruits, vegetables uh, et cetera, et cetera. You think -- well you can get like -- you get protein from meat, right? Yeah, you're better off getting your protein from other stuff. I think like peanuts have protein or nuts of some kind. Oh gee, I don't even know on the top of my head, but I remember looking this up. And as it happens, we're uniquely evolved to need meat. Like if all the teeth of a mouth, for instance, even the pointy one is actually, you know, part of a normal plant eating mouth and such. There's no vital thing that you get only from meat and, you know, everyone knows we ought to eat more vegetables just to be healthy in general. Well, if you're a vegetarian, you'd probably eat up a lot more vegetables, one would think. 
And then getting back to the environment thing. Meat takes up a lot more resources. the math is on this, but like you could have x amount of corn or whatever to feed a cow which would feed so many people, but like, if you didn't have the cow eat the corn, and you cut out the middle then you end up feeding like a whole lot more people with the original amount of corn -- if everyone was eating corn, or whatever. But we're not, we're eating cows, which is much less efficient, takes up much more land, much more resources. 
And I don't know if you've been attention, just last couple of decades or something, but somewhat iffy on the resources bit. The population going up, granted, not up as fast as was predicted. Uh, global warming getting worse so thankfully there's more, um, awareness of it, so hopefully we'll turn something around here at some point. I mean just the general principle that I like to divide -- not using more resources than I need, which I'm not going to pretend to be a saint in that regard, but I like the principle of it anyway. 
You eat the thing which is, you know, could feed more people -- eat them in the more efficient sort of way. And that way happens to be healthier. Put those two together, that is enough for -- yeah, I should be a vegetarian. 
So I've been thinking about that one the last few weeks and I've been eating less meat at meals. I can get more salad and stuff. Haven't really switched over yet. But I ought to and the rest of the world ought to and we'd save ourselves a lot of resources and a lot of headaches of a very, you know, medical crap that happens because we don't get enough of random nutrients that we ought to get. I don't think those multivitamin pills are really going to help you with that. For some reason, they're not exactly sure why, but for some reason it's so much better to get nutrients out of actual food than a pill. Like the pill may help but not half as much as the food. 
It's healthier. Being a vegetarian, it's more efficient, and thus, you know, better for the environment -- you use less resources. And there might even be a moral question to boot in there, so yeah. I ought to be a vegetarian, I ought to, getting around to that, and I'm pretty sure the rest of the world ought to be to. 
Or at least, you know, you don't have to go one hundred percent vegetarian, but like eat less meat maybe? Could you -- could we all try that? We'd all of us just eat like ten percent less meat than you would otherwise. You know, just see if that works. Take this a step at a time, I don't know. Thanks for watching, see you.
