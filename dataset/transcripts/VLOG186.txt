Sensor all books, point at things! So summer is here, most people that means, you know, like relaxing and having fun. No, I have to get another job. I am pretty much like a UPS man now. A lot of you had had me on MySpace, probably like three hundred of you or so 'cause I know I don't know most of MySpace friends, but I guess MySpace is this new IM thing that automatically appears in front of my screen. So if you want to, I'm always on MySpace and it always startles me when people just randomly, bading din, message me but I will always talk back, always. So feel free to message me. Obviously, I don't go to school. So what else am I going to do? MySpace. If you noticed, the fish tank noise is gone because I just filled up my fish tank for you. Don't thank me or anything, whatever. Last time I did make a video, I had six hundred sixty six subscribers. I know, creepy, and I now have nine hundred sixty seven, so that's, uh, three hundred and one more. So welcome, this is pretty much all I do. And after that statement, I am back to six hundred sixty six. 
So I want to talk about Swine Flu, an epidemic that is just all over the country. People are dying left and right. The Mexican baby died, you know. I know it is not super huge in the media, the newspapers and everything like it was maybe two weeks ago, but I didn't make a video two weeks ago -- so, today is two weeks ago. Well, just in case you might think that you have Swine Flu, I am going to put a link in the sidebar, I'm don't know which way it is -- a link in the sidebar that you can click on and see if you have Swine Flu. This has concerned me ever since I was a child, um -- would somebody please tell me if they have a tongue like I do? That only looked incredibly retarded but, uh, yeah, I have like, a little crease in it -- and it -- and I don't know why. 
So the new Star Trek movie came out like what, two weeks ago, a week and a-half ago, I have seen four times. More importantly, the movie is incredible and if you haven't seen it you should go see it. It is really, really good. Olson -- he's the one who goes down to blow up the thing, sorry if I am spoiling it. Anyway he has the red shirt. He dies. I thought that it was really cool that they put that in there. 
Most of the comments that I get on my videos are really, you know, favorable and then I get some bad ones but comments -- I read all of them by the way -- um, comments that I get that are like, I can't believe that you don't have a boyfriend and the blah, b blah, b blah, b blah. It's because I want a girlfriend. I'm kidding, no. It's my personality that -- I have tried my entire life -- and I'm in a wheelchair-- to be caller number nine or six or one through eighty, but I never get anywhere. I finally won tickets. And guess what I won tickets to? The beard and mustache world championship -- I think that I am going to die alone with cats and a bunch of you are too, so don't feel bad for me. Everybody loves a cat -- I'll still go. I don't even care. I'll go. So yeah, there's hope for you. So go out there and find someone, and if that person you have to gag and just throw into your van and to get, you know what things have to be done. You have to take chances. In, like, criminal record sort of chances. 
Another trend that is no longer a trend but since I haven't made a video, I'll talk about it. Is whatever her name is, large lady using things very well -- Britain's Got Talent. I don't care. I am sick to death listening to people say, oh, oh, she can sing so well, blah, b blah, b blah, but really, just because she is ugly we are suddenly going to talk about her? I mean come on, ugly people have skills too, you know, if anything we're demeaning her by saying she shouldn't be able to sing because she's ugly. It is a horrible stare -- I mean, if we say that we might as well say, oh, she can walk? I didn't know that ugly people can walk. Did that girl just graduate high school? She's ugly; I didn't know that ugly people knew anything. In fact let's broaden that, any reality show, period. I don't care about. They are people -- in fact I see repeat people. People who would be on one reality show and then would be on another reality show that is completely unconnected. These people are probably just actors that are trying to get their name out there and here they are acting like they are human beings. Actors are not human beings. Look at Tom Cruise. 
Some kids at school have been giving me crap about having a YouTube account and they are probably watching this, get Reese who ever else. Anyway, they say everybody who watches me is a total perv and I would like to disagree. Only like seventy eight percent of them are total pervs. So, what is that? Seventy eight, so twnety -- twenty two percent are, you know nice people. And I bet all of that twenty two percent is watching right now and I bet that seventy eight percent is just unsubscribing or staring at my chest. I don't know. I don't know but it's happening right now. 
Another little weird thing is that I won tickets on the radio. You call in and you win things. I have tried my entire life to call in and be caller number nine or six or one eighty, but I never get it. Well I finally won tickets, and guess what I won tickets to? The beard and mustache world championship. I'll still go. I don't even care. I'll go.
