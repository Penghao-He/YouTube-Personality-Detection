So when I was thinking about videos that I could do for my YouTube page, I was actually considering doing a video about a child that my family and I sponsor in Ethiopia. But then, I went to the XXXX page and they were talking about Project for Awesome, two thousand and eight, and I thought it was a perfect opportunity for me to talk about this charity. The charity I have chosen to talk about is called Compassion. A lot of people are talking about how they're suffering, and because of the economic turmoil that Canada, the U. S. , the whole entire world is going through right now. And even though that is true, we have to take a step back and realize that there are people all around the world who are suffering far mean children, mainly because they really can't do much for themselves. 
So on their website you can pick a child, deciding on what gender you want, the age, the country they live in, it -- it really doesn't matter, or you can ask for them to send you a random child in the mail that you can sponsor for thirty five dollars a month. Now, that's the Canadian price. I have absolutely no idea what it is in other countries, because they are situated 'round the world, so you would have to go to the specific website for your country to find out how much it is to sponsor a child. The story about how my family actually decided to sponsor a child is pretty interesting. I was in tenth grade, and I went to a concert for a Christian singer I really like, called Rebecca Saint James. And I went with my dad, and we were pretty close, we were like, in the fourth row, or something like that, and she was talking about how her, and her home, and her family, sponsored children through Compassion. 
And, I don't know, just the way she was describing it and how she actually went over there and got to see how her money and other people's money were being put to good use, it just touched me and I really, like, I couldn't obviously -- I couldn't afford it because I was fifteen at the time -- I just really asked my dad if, um, we could sponsor this child. So she asked the audience to raise your hand if you wanted, like, a little portfolio thingy for a child, and uh, I raised our hand, and we got this child called Senit . Here she is. Also on the sheet, it explains where exactly your money is going. So it says that it helps provide your sponsored child with medical checkups, clothing, recreational activities, tutoring, tuition, and scholastic materials. So I thought that was really great that you know exactly where your money's going, and what is being provided for your child. So you know that he or she is going to be well taken care of. 
So there we go. I told you a little bit about Compassion, what they do, and, you know, even if you -- if you can't afford to make any sort of donation or even sponsor a child, maybe you know somebody who can, and -- or you can try and raise awareness about it, too. Now, I really want the thumbnail to show up for -- so I'm going to just have the next a minute -- a minute to two minutes -- of the thumbnail in hopes that it'll let me pick it, so, the video's ending now. Thank you for listening.
