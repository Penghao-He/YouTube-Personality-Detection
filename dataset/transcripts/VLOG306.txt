Hey. This is XXXX withXXXX and I am kind of quiet because it's late at night, and I'm putting together a couple of things before I wrap things up for the night. 
One of them being, I am signed on to TMottGoGo website, which is a really cool website. It's www. tmottgogo. com. Anyway, I've gone there to um, donate to that website. The creator and the manager of the website is a very cool person. So, I wanna make sure that that website is kept up and running because it certainly doesn't run on well wishes. So I'm doing my part and I'm donating a little. So, I recommend you do the same, if you know what I mean. It certainly would help things run smoothly. 
So, I'm working on that, and I guess I want to talk to you about something that I discovered last few days. Um, I went -- let's see when was it? On Tuesday, which was two days ago, I took a uh, sort of a lesson. Something that was very challenging for me, and I took this lesson, and this is something I was really nervous about. It's the type of thing where you -- you dream about it the night before because you're very concerned and you are worried about it, and um, anyway. So, this person was a huge help to me and teaching and guiding me and taking time with me, and I'm so very, very thankful. 
Now afterwards, I guess the custom, perhaps, might have been to tip this person. And this person said, listen, the best thing you can do for me is to write a thank you note. And I thought, well sure, of course I'll write a thank you note. And he said, yeah, because my supervisors, you know, the people that -- that I manage or the people that I work with, really know that kind of job I do, but my supervisors really may not know. 
So, this was, you know, the thing I could do to help him along so that he could make the advancements that he might need to make in his career and I was like, sure. You know, I felt so grateful for him helping me. 
Okay, well the thing that I didn't expect to happen was that, not only did I feel grateful for this wonderful, um, thing that happened. But um, just, like, donating to the um, TMottGoGo site to keep that up and running makes me feel very good, writing this thank you note, simple act to do, didn't take a lot of time, really didn't, like, you know, kill me to do it, obviously, uh, you know, felt very good to show my appreciation for somebody in this way. And to know that it would help their career. 
Um, anybody that shows that kind of commitment and care uh, to what they're working on, I think deserves huge, huge props. And I say props in that they -- they -- they -- why not give somebody like that extra encouragement, extra help? I know I appreciate when somebody says thank you to me. I save all my notes. When somebody gives me encouragement, I mean the smallest little nugget, I definitely appreciate. So it felt good to say thank you. 
So I encourage you to do that. I encourage everybody to continue to encourage others. Saying thank you goes a long way. Writing thank you goes a long way. Donating what we can to lend a helping hand to other folks usually reaps rewards beyond your imagination. 
So, if you can um, try donating to TMottGoGo. Uh, try writing a thank you note. Try a couple of those things. I guarantee you it's gonna feel really good. 
And I think I'll wrap up what I'm working on tonight and sign off and I'll see you around. 
Maybe next week, I'll have some photographs or paintings to show because I've certainly been working. 
All right, bye.
