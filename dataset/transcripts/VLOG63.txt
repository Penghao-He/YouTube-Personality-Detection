Hey debris . How you freaking doing, eh? I haven't a vlogged in a long time. Mostly I'm trying to entertain your asses with some kind of stupid -- stupid act, but I thought, you know what, let me be real for one time. Well, not for once, because really me trying to entertain you, but, I see that it really doesn't have much effect, you know, even when I did the little and got over two hundred views. No new subscribers so I, you know, whatever. I'm just going to do what I do and we'll see what happens, you know what I'm saying? 
That's right. Mary Posta's having a beer, chilling out after a long day at work. Actually, it's pretty late right now. I'm going to be going to bed in a little while, but I wanted to get that vlog out to a few people out there. My public, my adoring fans, all fifteen of you. Yeah, you know what? Something really cool freaking happened to me after I got home from work. Um, I drive up, uh, behind my house and I'm walking up the stairs and I see this helicopter, kinda like circling around, you know, and flying around, and I thought, wow that's a pretty cool looking helicopter. And uh, it was one of those jet copters, you know. And uh -- eh, I didn't think much about it. It was all really high up in the air, and I go into my house and, you know, drop my keys and change into some shorts and a t shirt and you know get out of the office clothes. 
And I put on the TV and I start watching some Seinfeld and all of a sudden a really loud sound of the helicopter. I can tell it's like overhead, it's over the -- over, excuse me, over the house. I'm like, whoa, that's pretty -- flying pretty low, isn't it? And so I kinda look out my front bay window, in the front here. And all of a sudden I can see that the leaves and the trees are rustling and all that, and the wind is blowing everywhere. And right in front of my house, this helicopter is landing in the street right in front of my freaking house. 
How many times in your life have you ever seen a helicopter land exactly in front of your house? And I -- I see it's uh the Broward County Sheriff's, uh, department helicopter. And it's funny -- you know, it's not like I did anything. You know, I don't have a record, I don't have any outstanding warrants, but when I saw that, I'm think-- I still had this feeling like they were coming for me, like, did I do something? Why the hell are they landing under my house? You know, then I'm like, no, no. Of course, you know, I blew that off real fast, but it was funny that I had that initial reaction, like, oh shit, you know, they're coming for me. And so this freaking helicopter lands in front of my house. And I'm like, what the hell are they doing? And I see the -- like, I walk up to the front of my window and I'm standing there with this confused look on my face, and I see the pilot look over at me and then, like, you know, finish, like, doing his landing. And I'm like, shit, you know , what's going on here? 
And uh, so uh doors open and this guy gets out from the side and he goes over to the back and opens up some doors in the back and he pulls out this, like, hospital gurney like what they have for ambulances and everything. I'm like, oh, something must be going on, like, next door or in the neighborhood. So I open the door and I come outside and I look around to the side and then I see, a little bit further down, a bunch of cars and an ambulance and all the stuff over there off to the side. And I'm like, uh okay, maybe , like there were less trees or something. And you know, like that was the best landing spot. But then he took, like, you know, the medical stuff over there to like where the paramedics were. 
But, yeah, the whole neighborhood was out there, watching what was going on. Apparently some -- somebody, you know, had some kind of medical issue. I really don't know what it is. You know, um, I saw the -- the firemen were directing everybody to get away from the area, and instead of crowding around. So I didn't want to be a jerk and go out there, what is going on? I gotta know. We didn't do it, who got hurt? I gotta know everything; I'm a nosy body, you know. 
Yeah, so I didn't want to be like that. So you know, I'm minding my own business. You know, somebody got hurt, they're going to the hospital, that's all I gotta to know, right? So they put some lady in the back, it looked like a lady, into the back of the helicopter. The helicopter flew away. And it had to be serious if they called in a helicopter so I said a little prayer for the person. I hope they're doing okay. And uh that was the big excitement when I got home today from work. 
And occasionally I slip into my accent because like I got family from the South on my Mama's side, you know, other times you'll hear me have a little street accent; you know, I did a little soul. That's cause I grew up in Chicago. And then you know, occasionally I like do a little, you know, thing, you know, my background in Chicago, you know. But anyway. So what was I talkn' about? Oh yeah, so the helicopter. Woo hoo. Yeah, I know, maybe it's not that an exciting story but how many of you could've claimed to have a helicopter land in front of your house, huh? 
You know, another thing I wanted to talk about was anti American sentiment on YouTube. I saw this one video in a clip or at -- actually you know the comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen and he was in an interview with Conan O'Brien on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien show, and he was doing the whole interview as the Borat character. And I didn't see the movie because, honestly, that kinda humor is a little over the top for me. And I get -- I get seriously nervous when I watch somebody be that outlandish, especially with people who don't know what's going on. Um, and so I've been putting off watching the movie, even though I'm sure it's going to be funny when I get around to seeing it. But anyway, the point is I saw this clip on tube of this interview and I put a quote in there -- a comment was -- which said, I'm curious to know if any Arabs find Sacha Baron Cohen's characterization offensive? Because I , but I saw Borat doing the voice. You know, he's telling people he's from, you know, whatever country he's from. I thought he was imitating an Arabic guy, um then somebody replies in the comment calling me, you know, you stupid American, stupid fucking stupid American, and you know -- Borat is not Arab um, you know, learn your fucking geography and you know, but I don't blame you because, you know, you're an American. And you know, some -- all this anti American rage which just got thrown at me. But the thing was, maybe I'm wrong, okay, and the character is not supposed to be an Arab, okay. Whatever ethnic background he's supposed to be. I thought he was imitating an Arab and I thought, you know what, maybe, you know, some Arabs wouldn't like this guy and would feel bad when they saw this, saw them making fun of him. I was trying to be nice, say, you know, I'm curious. Do you find that offensive? Does that make you mad when you see that, you know? I'm trying to be racially sensitive to people out there or ethnically sensitive or whatever the hell it is. I'm just trying to be, you know, uh, sensitive to the feelings of other people out there, my fellow brothers and sisters. And then I get this kind of hatred, this rage back for my trouble. And this isn't the first time that I've encountered this kinda comments or seen those kinda comments on the internet and I gotta wonder, you know, why --
I've talked about this before in a previous video, even though I erased the video before. Why is there so much hatred, against America and Americans, from other countries? You know, uh a lot of times they claim that we're ignorant about their culture or the things that they're doing, but I gotta tell ya, I've talked to foreign through the internet, and a lot of them know just about jack about the United States as well . All they know about the United States is from what they see in movies and TV, and you know as well as I do that most of that.
