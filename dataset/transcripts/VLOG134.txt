Hey Shinies . You know how said that I wouldn't make a habbit out of, um, you know, making direct uploads. Well I slept for, I don't know, a lot of hours today, so, yeah. And I actually had a lot to do because I have to pack because I'm leaving on Wednesday to go to Wisconsin and I wanted to just upload my video from last Monday. But then I was like, ehh, but I want to inform them that I am leaving on Wednesday, so, nyah, ya, -- it was -- it was a conundrum and this is my solution. 
So, I'm leaving on Wednesday to go to Wisconsin. And I guess that that could be considered a tradition, because I usually go up north around the winter time, ah, and summer too, usually, but I don't know, whatever. Ah, as far as other traditions, usually we'll put the Christmas tree up the day after, um, Thanksgiving but we didn't because we have no idea where we are going to put it. Ah, yeah, mmm, I forgot what else I wanted to talk about, mmm, oh this video is so crap. 
Um, next Monday I will be making a proper video though and it will be from a different location. It will be from Wisconsin. Um, so that's cool. Ah, yeah, I will be staying with Debbie, which is my dad's girlfriend, which is really complicated if you know the story of my dad. Um, okay, ah, I'll be watching her kids for some of the time, Benden and Ellen , ah, just like I did when I went in the summer? No, last winter. I don't know, whatever. No, last winter and the summer. Yeah, I have been there a lot recently, I guess. 
Um, oh, there was other stuff that I had to talk about. Mmm, I forget. Um, well this is over two minutes, so I guess that's long enough. Right? Um, I don't know. I feel like I am forgetting something really important. This is great that you get to see me two weeks -- well not two weeks in a row but two times that I posted in a row just rambling because they're direct uploads, so, yeah, YouTube should really add an editing feature to where you can view it afterwards, edit it and then -- yeah, that'd be nice. So, get on that YouTube. Okay, um, ah, I hope you guys have good luck uploading this week, ah -- I really know that I'm forgetting something and as soon as I click stop it's going to come into my head and then I am going to feel stupid. Okay, well, stay shiny and happy I'll see you tomorrow sharp, maybe?
