Hi guys, this is XXXX. I know it's' been a very long while since I've blogged last and I promised you that when I get to a new place drug wise I'm gonna blog and I started a job about a week and a half ago so here I am back in the YouTube world. And -- um -- some of you know my birthday was the thirty first of October and so many of you went into my Face book page and wished me happy birthday. It was heartwarming and overwhelming to see so many people who took the time to post on my wall and say something and comment on some of the other peoples who posted. It was great -- great. Sometimes I feel like people on the internet are kinder and thoughtful -- more thoughtful than people who -- you realize take things for granted. 
Anyway, I started a new job and not really in the mood to celebrate just yet. It's -- it's just me. I'm that way. When I get into a new place, getting into the door is not enough for me to feel like I made it. After about two three months that I know they're happy with me and I'm happy with them, then I know that I've found my place. That I'm willing and able to settling there for a few years and feel -- you know -- at home as much as a workplace can get home. So of course it's much better than being unemployed. I finally have a car back and a new cell phone could be's coming Sunday or Monday and -- you know -- all those things. Chatting with people all through the day. I feel like sometimes I -- you know -- talk too much at work after -- I feel like I've been deprived of enough human contact in the last few months. So they -- they say that I -- I feel like I don't -- I can't stop talking and -- it will slow down in a few days or so. 
Anyway, just wanted to touch base with you people and as I promised once I get a new job I'm gonna blog a lot more so get ready to hear from me -- to hear from me a lot more in the next couple of months and of course not just stopping by to say hello, but taking issues and taking the time to blog about things I care about. And there have been plenty of subjects in the last few weeks to talk about. So I'm getting into gears. Getting back on the horse of blogging is weird. Something that's -- if you only stop doing for a few weeks or months you suddenly feel like you never quit or like you don't really know how to go on but it's like riding a bike. It's gonna get -- uh -- really familiar, really soon. Anyway, thanks for watching. Bye for now.
