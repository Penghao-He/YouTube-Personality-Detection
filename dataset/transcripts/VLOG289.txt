Oh my gosh, y'all. I am in my hotel room at Disney World. I'm freaking out, it's so nice. Look this is when you walk in. You've got a little bathroom area and a bathroom in there, and then you've got like this cute little area and these little things, and then a closet and then a bed. Here's where with all my crap on it. Oh, my gosh, huge TV. Holy crap, there's my computer. Oh my gosh, and then I came out here a minute ago and you are not going to believe what just happened to me. Oh, I'm glowing, oh lord. Um, there is -- look at my view. I don't know if you can see much, but you can pretty much just see the glare, but it's like a pool over there; there's a pool over there, and then over there you can't see any more. It's not happening any more. The fireworks at Magic Kingdom are happening. I was watching them and I was like, my life is so great right now. 
Anyway, so I'm in Orlando and I kind of want to explain to you guys why, because I feel like some of you don't know, but I really want to update you. I've got a few messages, but I just wanted to let everybody know at the same time. I'm doing the Disney College Program, so I'm going to live down here until January at least and work at the parks and, um, excuse me, and then like take some classes maybe, I don't know yet. But I check in tomorrow and like move into my apartment in the South Side. I'm staying in the hotel room tonight. I'm really glad I did because it's really nice, but yeah, that's what I'm doing in Florida. For everyone that was wondering, um, yeah, this is Delane's blog but I just wanted to tell you because I'm so excited and I wanted to show you my room. 
Um, yeah, well, um, the drive down was okay. I had like, it was like ten hours, but I stopped in Jacksonville to hang out with my BFF's fam. Sam therefore I-am, who is like the love of my life, he is so precious. And we had dinner with his family and we went shopping and I bought a bunch of crap, so, yeah, that's what I'm doing with my life right now; that's what is happening. I have to get some dinner -- a room service dinner because I'm hungry. 
But yeah, so, I hope you guys are well, and if you guys live -- I know a lot of you guys live in Florida or near Disney, come and see me, let's hang out. Seriously, if you're ever at Disney just me on Twitter and tell me where you are and we'll all hang out when I'm not working; seriously, because I want to meet you guys. 
Yeah, so I'm here and I'm so excited, oh my gosh, I just want to jump on this bed, and I'm actually going to do so because it's so huge and I love it. 
So me on Twitter if you're ever around Disney and you want to hang out. I'm so excited. You can follow me on Twitter, twitter dot com XXXX, I'll put a link on the sidebar, but yes I'm just really excited and I wanted to share my excitement with you, but this is getting really long and boring, so I've got to go. I love you guys so much and I'm starting everything tomorrow so I'll be really, really busy, but I just wanted to let you know. 
So I'll talk to you soon! Love you guys! Here's a half a heart. You can do the other half, okay.
