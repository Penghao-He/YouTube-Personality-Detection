So Christina asked us to talk about our first computer. Basically, my dad has had a computer in our house my whole life and my parents would use it for like writing their sermons and stuff, so it made sense for them to have one. And my earliest use of the computer was to play games like the Aladdin computer game. I remember I had a lot of fun with that one; there was another one the Toy Story computer game and I remember having, um, Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, the computer game. 
When we lived in Minnesota my neighbors had the Indian Jones Atlantis game. I remember playing that; I loved that game and then they also had a game that was put together similarly, but it was a game about these tentacles that took over the world; how you got to actually travel forward and backward in time; to like save the world from the tentacles. 
In elementary school I remember we got like computer time; like our computer class every like week. We would play weird games likes, um, the name of the game was Thinking Things. I remember that had Thinking Things One, Thinking Things Two, Thinking Things Three and like you got to play like different games within it; and I remember there was like Reading Rabbit from like when we were learning how to read. And like different games like that. 
I just found it was like really fun stuff. I remember when we first got the internet I think I was like eight years old when we got the internet. Yeah, I remember it would take like a day for the email to get from your computer to their computer. So, it was just weird and I would say definitely a lot has changed since I got my first computer. Although it's still the Mac. It's still the Mac; it's a much better Mac.
