Hi. This is the New York offices um, Hodgkins, What Makes Me, Me? And, um, I think what makes me, me is the fact that I'm nineteen years old, but I still act like a little kid. And, um, also what makes me, me is the fact that I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan. Yeah. And, um, I have all his -- almost all his -- stuff. And, um, I pretty much have, um, all his films. Actually, I have one -- first production that I have, that I hold a close to my heart that I have. 
Another thing that makes me unique is, yeah, I fall sleeping without making at all. Yeah really mature. . Um, and I also like all kinds of music like Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, AM, Plain and Simple, , Fall boy, Charlie. and I like --
Um, I try to live my day -- I try to live each day like it was my last. I really try to do that. Um -- and, um, I try, like, not to take things too seriously. Um, I try to not feel like I change for anybody. I really don't 'cause like what's the point? If I'm going to change for people I'm not going to be happy, it just doesn't make any sense. Pretty much doesn't make . Um, that's pretty much what makes me, me. There's not really that much. And I kind of have a low self esteem so I'm not -- 'cause I was made fun of a lot and, yeah. It's really hard to try and disassemble all that. But it also makes me, me and I hope you like watching this 'cause, um, I love your videos. Your rocks my non wearing socks that I'm not wearing cause I'm not wearing any right now. Yeah, um, ha , ha. So, yeah. Bye.
