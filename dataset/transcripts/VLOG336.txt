Hi, um, I want to talk seriously in this video and I know it's been a while, but I thought it was about time that you learn of my condition. Um, this is something I've learnt to deal with and I thought it was about time that you understood what it's like to live the way that I do. Um, although no one in my family suffered from this, it wasn't until school -- -- it wasn't until school that I became truly aware of how unique I was. 
The school kids say -- they used to call me names and the teachers used to make me sit at the back of the classroom with a bucket, and by the end of most lessons it was usually about full to the brim . I mean, can you imagine what it's like taking your GCSE exams when you're suffering from what I've got? 
There are some mornings when I wake up and I -- I don't even need to shower . Things have always been tough for me and now you know what it's like and I hope you'll accept me for who I am and not what I do .
