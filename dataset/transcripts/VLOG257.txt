Rockers. There's no sisters in this brotherhood. So I've got two older brothers and one younger brother. Their age range is from anywhere from twenty seven all the way down to about seventeen. So I'm kind of in the middle, but kind of not. You can actually see two out of three of them - do I collect anything? For now I've been collecting a year's worth of Netflicks envelopes and I've been putting them on my wall. I'm as you can tell, but back in the day I used to collect stamps and comic books of Archie and friends. Now, I don't watch sport very often, but I say when I do, my favorite sport to watch would probably be baseball and as far as favorite sports to play, I usually run track in field in High School and I used to run cross country. So yes, running is a sport. It's freaking hard. That's for sure. 
Hey, how's it going? Hola. Hello, is this thing on? So hi, how's it going? My name is XXXX I from the great state of California that is broke, lived in Southern California to be specific, and I've lived here all my life. How old am I? I'm the nice old age of twenty one. Couldn't get any better than that right now. My favorite color, it has to be red. Red? Red. Come on, what's wrong with the color red? I like red.
