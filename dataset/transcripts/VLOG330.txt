Hi. I'm making my first advice video, um, a little bit earlier than I intended. And it is for XXXX fan, XXXX, who video responded my last video, asking me a question. Um, before I do that -- before I give her my advice, I would just like to clarify that you want me to give you advice, you don't need to upload video unless you want to. Um, you can just e mail me at ask marbles at gmail. com and stay totally anonymous if you want. Just sign in as you'd like me to refer to you as. Does that make any sense? I don't know. 
If my voice sounds a little bit weird, I woke up with a cold today. Boo. So she asks me, um, what do I do when people make fun of me because I like Twilight? Um, you know, I have -- I myself, obviously have received a lot of, um, teasing, not just from, uh, people I don't know, but, like, friends and family and, you know, a lot from guys. Lots of guys. Ohhh, you like that Twilight stuff, well. Especially from people who haven't even actually read the books or seen the movie, they're just sick of seeing it everywhere and kind of approach it as High School Musical, but for like emo children. 
Mm, I don't know. Basically, you just gotta keep in mind that it's not actually personal and that, really, the person they're making fun of is themselves, especially in the case of them having not read the book or seen the movie. I mean, people are entitled to their opinions, obviously. But no one should ever make fun of you for liking something that they don't, unless it's done kind of, you know, playfully. And people will always tease each other about that kind of thing. Like, um, growing up I always used to make fun of my younger brother for liking Mighty Machines 'cause I thought it was the most boring show of life, basically. 
So the best thing you can do in that situation, whether it be, uh, in the comments on the video or -- or some random person at school who's commenting on your Team Edward shirt, or a family member, or whatever, is just keep in mind, well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And you can say that -- look them dead in the eye when you say that, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. There isn't much more they can say to that, because you're not -- even when you're disagreeing with them, you're kinda agreeing to disagree. And don't let other people, you know, knock you down just over something you happen to like. In the end their opinion, when it comes to your interest, doesn't matter. I think that helps. 
So click update while I'm, uh, making this video real quick. I've gotten a lot of responses to the book club thing. And I'm going to say the ones that are up for votes, will be, obviously, The One Hundred Names, The Immortal Instruments series and anything by John Green. Those seem to be the three most popular. 
So in comments, throw out which of the three you would prefer to have me talk about. And maybe you have advice for AJ. Probably you should give it to her as well. I'm going to -- well, obviously, make this a video response to her video, but until that happens I'll also link her video on the side. 
So. Ahh. Good times. I'm sorry; I wish I was more energetic. Oh, oh, and by the way, everybody who's been sending me private messages of encouragement, thank you so much. I do read them. I do. And, um, I'm trying to reply to all of them. And I do read all your comments as well. And I appreciate every piece of encouragement I've received. 
So, peace out. Peace out. Really. It's come to that, hasn't it?
