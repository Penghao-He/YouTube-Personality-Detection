The Project for Awesome has begun. So, to XXXX, this is the best time of year, because this is when we dominate YouTube with charity and goodness and awesomeness. And it's one of the days that we never forget to be awesome. And, you know what, it's gonna be great. And so when you're done with this video, comment it, and rate it, and then go to a bunch of other videos, and comment those, and rate those, and start conversations in the comments to get them on the front page of YouTube, so that people start realizing how important charity is -- and it's gonna be Awesome. So, that's why we call it the Project for Awesome. 
 Imagine a world where you have no choice for you, but your coffee. It was at Starbucks. That was the only place -- I mean it was one corporation. It had dominated everything else and all local businesses were gone, and the only place where you could buy your coffee was at Starbucks. Not much choice there. You can't decide for yourself what coffee you like better, you can't, you know, buy cheaper coffee. In -- it's -- it's -- our economy depends on local businesses, and that's why I am going to support what is not necessarily a charity, but it is a non profit organization, to support local businesses and help them thrive, and it's called the American Independence Business Alliance. 
So, how it works is local business decide to form alliances within their towns, and overall, all these alliances are springing up across America. And so, when you go on the website for the whole thing you can link to other cities websites, and sometimes you can even find your own city, and you might not have known this organization even existed, but it does. And you can go to the website, which is gonna be linked in the doobly doo. And then, when you get to the cities page, they have a list of all the businesses in that city that are part of the alliance, and that's a good place to start if you don't know where to shop locally. 
Not all cities have this, but a lot of them do, and if you find your city on that list then great, and go there, and shop there for Christmas. This is a great time of year to decide where you're going to shop. 
And the reasons why you should do this, are also gonna be linked in the doobly doo. It's an article, and I'm just gonna tell you a little bit about this research project that was done in Austin, Texas, comparing franchises and local businesses -- found out that on average -- at a Franchise, thirteen dollars out of a hundred goes back to the community in wages or uh, in taxes, things like that, thirteen dollars. At a local business, for every hundred dollars spent, forty five dollars goes back in taxes and wages and things, into the community. I mean, imagine how much more that's helping. Local businesses have to pay city taxes, and that goes to making your roads better -- it improves the community a lot. And then, you also have the fact that the businesses start to grow. If everyone engages in this kind of business, it starts to make local areas get stronger, and then when local areas get stronger the whole economy of America starts to get stronger. There's a lot of information on the website, and you can find out why it's important to buy locally. So, go to your local businesses and do your Christmas shopping there.
