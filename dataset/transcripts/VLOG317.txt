So as you can tell I'm back from my trip to California and let me tell you, it was one of the best summers I've had in a really long time. So before starting this video let me tell you that I did not get that much footage of me being in California because I was just basking in the awe of all these amazing people I met. Anyways if you can't tell the difference off the bat, I am pretty dark -- I got uh, a tan line from where my glasses were, and yeah, look at that -- pretty bad, uh, farmers' tan. Yeah so my flight to get to California was at six forty five a. m. I got to the airport and I flew from my city and then I had a connection flight in Atlanta, and while I was on the plane going to California, I was sitting in the window seat and there was two other women sitting next to me. One was like a middle aged woman and one was uh -- like a kind of, let's say, uh -- uh -- a fluffy woman. So I was sitting there, and an hour -- an hour and a half left of the flight, I needed to use the restroom, and both of the women were sleeping, and I didn't want to say, "Hey you fat girl, get up, I need to use the restroom". No, because that would be really rude. So I held my pee in -- it probably wasn't the best thing for my liver, whatever that affects your body but um, that was my flight experience, yeah. And during my stay there I met a lot of amazing people that I've been talking to online for a really long time, and to actually see their face was like so surreal -- I was like overwhelmed. Um, sorry if I leave your name out -- uh -- I'm trying to remember. I met XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. One day we decided, hey let's go hang out in the playground at the park. This is like the only footage that I have besides the one that I did with Christian -- the jumping video -- and if you guys haven't seen it, you could see it right here. There was this little, um, twisty thingy that you got on, and you spin and you spin and then you get off, and then it feels so -- I don't know. I -- I'm not really a fan of being dizzy, but everybody knows there actually how to do it, so um, roll the clip. 
Now, that was crazy and I was about to teach her an acoustic playlist and I heard so many amazing artists. And met a lot of cool people there and, ah, yeah, overall it was great, it was a fun night. Yeah, and I don't know how you guys, Southern Californians - I don't know if that's the right term -- like, stay in shape, like you guys have all of these delicious, ah, food restaurants and -- I don't even know how you guys contain that in that small, built -- anyways, um, I had a -- my first in and out and it was divine. And I had Yogurtland for the first time and it was amazing and I really wish that they had those kinds of foods here but they don't. 
Oh, and I had these Mexican burritos, um, it had meat, it had sour cream, it had fries. It was so good. So, as I mentioned about my previous video of me jumping with Christian. We went to this beach and we were recording and stuff and we were done and there kids were walking toward us. So, I was like, oh shoot. Then he grabbed my pen and -- sign your autograph. No, and these teens they were so obnoxious. They asked us all these questions and they were like, what is that-- what are you recording for? Is this going to be on YouTube? What's your YouTube name? If you are one of them and you are watching this video right now, um, you guys shouldn't be obnoxious. And there was this one girl that randomly decided, hey, I think that I'm going to lick XXXX's camera. And she fricking licked my lens and I'm like --
Shh. Oh, and then I went to the and XXXX, but I'm the type of person that really doesn't like rollercoasters -- if you guys were there you would understand. I'm usually the guy that's back and watch people's stuff, but it was really fun. And I met Christine, Kevin, Wongfu Guys, Philip, Tad and Wes, and David, and Natalie, and Evendy my home girl, yeah. So, my California trip was definitely an experience that I won't forget and I definitely will be going there again sometime soon. 
Um, oh yeah, I'm in the process of moving my stuff to my new place, because school is starting soon -- ah, I don't even want to think about school. And, I recently reached over three thousand subscribers and I just want to say thanks for everyone for watching my videos and still thinking that they're semi entertaining. But, yeah, I just want to say thanks for watching and subscribing and rating and commenting and favoriting and all that shebang. I think that's it. Um, guys want to see my tan line again? Uh, it's ridiculous.
