You know what I see - - no, more like hear a lot these days, is people calling other people gay as an insult. Now what makes people come up with calling others gay? Now here's an example. Hey, hey, you wanna trade Pokemon or Ziegfield cards? Or, or, or we can play, we can play superheroes. Oh, can I be Optimus Prime? Dude, you are so gay. Dude, the cool kids do crack. Oh, my mommy says, say no to drugs. Okay, how the hell does playing Pokemon cards or -- or --- or dancing or holding hands with another guy make me homosexual? I don't get these people. 
This is how it is in my school. Okay, here's an example. All right, um, when they see two guys are gay, they're together, they're like no, ew, no. No, no that -- that doesn't go together - - you know, two guys, no. two sticks, no. It just doesn't work like . But when they see two girls, they're like, get it on. And I don't get these people. I've never seen someone say like, oh, you're so homosexual or you're so lesbian or you're such a child molester. It is always the word gay, cause apparently gay is now an insult, even though the word means like happy and lively and that kinda giddy feeling you have inside, like -- -- but no you have to turn that happy word into a mean word. Apparently, we can do that now, turning good things into bad things. It's like how Spiderman felt good, but then that -- that -- that grease that gets all over him and then and then evil Dr. Octopus. That's so gay, you like Spiderman. Lar, I'm going to the movies with the guys to watch Mama Mia. 
You never know if other people are offended by what you say. I'm not saying you're a bad person if you do it. I used to do it all the time. I'm more focused on why we say it. In the end, we're all the same. You know, there's nothing wrong with it. I was just wondering where it all came from, you know. All right, thanks a lot for watching.
