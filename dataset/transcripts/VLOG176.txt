Okay internet, real quick. We're gonna do a little cooking Japanese lesson. My mother was kind enough to send me one of my favorite pasta dishes and it is shells and real aged cheddar from the -- came from the States. And so it's there and it's fine and I guess I'm gonna -- I'm gonna make it. It's been in my, um, pantry for about two months and -- you know it's pasta though so it's fine. 
So I made it. Here it is. Look at this. Oh yeah, this is -- I put some, uh, some potatoes and some carrots, yeah. This is the good stuff. But when I was cooking it, I realized, oh wait, I need to mix some milk with the powdered cheese and, uh, yeah, I need a quarter cup low fat milk. See? Right there. And, uh, it takes about eight to ten minutes to cook once it's at full boil so I was like eight to ten minutes? Seven Eleven is only three minutes away, I can do this. 
So you know, I go to Seven Eleven, I buy the product of choice which I was hoping would be milk but instead I grabbed this guy. This is another lesson in why I need to learn Japanese completely. It looks like milk, doesn't it, you got like white liquid pouring into glasses, yeah, it looks great. So I buy it, five hundred milliliters worth and I mix it with -- with the -- the cheese. Now the catch is that this is not milk, this is like sweet something and here's -- here's what I make of it. It says, uh, sheedoi which is white sheedoi, oisheedsa which I am assuming is like white deliciousness or something along those lines. New San king , so new San king, okay, could be milk. And then here in the yellow it says, cream cheese -- cream cheese. I did not bother to read that. So I guess it's not the fact that I couldn't read but that I was in a hurry to get back here and so I didn't read, and I just went by the pictures which is a bad choice. So what I got was sweet cream cheese juice which you know, is kind of good to drink, you know it's not bad, it sounds kind of nasty but it's all right so as a result I have instead of the average Annie's shells and real aged cheddar, I have sweet cream juice version of that. And, um, you know, I made a lot of it too. Ah. It's all right, it's -- it's kind of sweet, it's got this kind of funky side to it. You know, funky is good, so -- learn to read and be patient when trying to read. Peace.
