Okay, so, Sunday I took the kids the kids to the mall because it was raining. We couldn't skate. Just -- just don't ask questions, okay? That's what we did. We went to the mall. Bad idea. It's way too close to Christmas. Very packed, not fun. Don't do it. Anyways, um, so we went into the skate shop/surf shop/we sell girls' underwear kind of place. Um -- I live four hours away from the ocean. So for anybody to actually surf around here is kind of uncommon. I don't know why there is a surf shop here. I mean -- I assume they have them at the beach as well. So why not just wait till you got the beach to buy your -- but anyways, anyways - surf shop in the mall. Oh! That makes a whole lot of sense. Um -- shit, that pisses me off. 
 So anyways, what we do is we always go in there and we -- we raise a little alley. You know, we try on the wet suits -- which by the way smell like frog. I don't know if you guys knew that. Wet suits smell like frog. But that might just be because I've been in every single, uh, wet suit in there and, uh, sweat in them. Which makes them sweat suits. Just kidding. Um -- they smell like frogs though, seriously. Um -- and like stick up little -- little local skate shop stickers. And -- it -- it -- it's good times, okay. We -- we -- best thing to do, okay, when we go in there, ask them questions about their skateboards. It's hilarious. Okay. So I go back there and I -- I've been doing a little bit of research on these new gimmick skateboard -- skateboards, like -- like the Almost Impact and the -- and the Pearlite and obviously the P two. Um, so I see the Pearlite on the wall and I'm like okay, this is gonna be fun. I walked into the guy. I'm like, "Hey, what can you tell me about that uh -- that Plan B Pearlite over there? " He gets it out and he's like "Um --" Reads the packaging. "It's -- its' lighter, thinner, stronger. Yeah, that's what the packaging says. That's exactly what it is. I hear great things about these all the time. They're just -- they're awesome. You should probably buy one like right now. " And I'm like, "Good God dude" and I'm freaking. I went into this whole spiel. I'm pretty sure I quoted the entire website on his ass. Awesome. Awesome. 
And then this kid walks up. I wish he had done that when I was owning the dude. And he's like, "Hey I want that baker board over there and I want it gripped with Jessup. " Jessup makes you mess up. Okay. Dawn, that's for you. That was a little weird. I'm not gonna laugh. Anyways, so the guy -- the guy's trying to grip this board, right? And -- and he's trying to train this other dude too because -- well, I don't really know. It was kind a like the blind leading the blind. But anyways, he just kind 'a throws the grip tape at it and it sticks. And it's -- its like -- I don't know how it stuck and had that many bubbles in it. It was absolutely insane. I don't understand how that even happened. It looked like a hot dog with -- with -- you know -- the baker logo on the bottom down here and the grip tape on the top. It was ridiculous. I don't know how he got that many air bubbles in it. He didn't sand down the edges, he just sat there and he poked out all the air bubbles with pins and then flattened out the grip tape. I was like you idiot I wanna slap you on the freaking mouth right now. I have literally not wanted to grip a board so bad in my entire life. Like I just wanted to push him out of the way. Like flip him over the glass counter and do it myself. Pisses me off. It was so bad. And then, he doesn't -- he doesn't file down the edges or anything like that that you would normally do when you're gripping a skateboard. No. No. He just throws the grip tape on there and starts trying to cut it out and can't figure out why it's all freaking wavy and crap and it doesn't look anything like it should look. It was awful. It looked disgusting. I wanted to punch him in the mouth. Anyways, that's one story. 
Another story -- shit -- I forgot which one I was gonna tell you guys. Ah -- what did we do? Oh -- yeah -- um, so local skate shop again was having this -- this contest for t shirt designs and skateboard designs. And Deshawn had drawn up a bunch of designs. And, uh, he didn't realize that because he wasn't eighteen yet he couldn't enter the contest without his parent's signature. And I wasn't about to drive a half hour to go home to get his mom to sign a sheet of paper and then drive back. So the guys at the skate shop were like, "Hey, if you just go out to the car and sign this yourself, we'll never know. " And I'm like well -- that's a lot less fun. So what we're gonna do is, we're going to the mall and we'll talk to you guys in a little bit. So we were walking in the mall and we were looking for a girl. Any girl would've done really. But we got all the way to this Malinick's place before we found anybody. And we got in there and there's these two cute little blond girls sitting at the counter. Not doing anything because that place doesn't sell shit because they fucking bick . But anyways. So we get up there and Deshawn is like "Hey, I need you guys to sign this so that I could get in this contest -- right? " And they were like, "Oh cool. We could do that. Yeah, we could pretend to be your mom. What's your name? " He tells her his name and shit like that. And they're -- they're taking turns writing on this sheet of paper -- not the actual form -- but just random pieces of paper, to see who has the better signature. And they finally decided who has the better signature and they sign it and they're like, "Oh, cool. I hope you win that contest. Don't break your arm or anything. I'm like "You fucking idiots. It says right on it that it's an art competition. He's drawing something. Is he really gonna break his arm drawing something? " They thought this was a legitimate skate contest and that 200 pound Deshawn was gonna be in it and -- and win the shit. What? Use your brain people. 
Anyways, I'm gonna go now. I have a lot more to say because I'm a little bit hyper. But I -- I'm gonna leave at that. Um -- do you guys -- do you guys do this too or is it just me? Am I the only person in the world that does this? Because I think it's freaking great.
