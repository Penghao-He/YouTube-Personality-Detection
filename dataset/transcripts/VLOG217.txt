Hey, guys. So, like ten in the morning and I've been up like all night. I woke up yesterday at like, oh, about two thirty in the afternoon yesterday. Then I went back to sleep because I was really tired. Then I slept 'til like six. So I've been up since then. It's like, yeah. I'm getting pretty tired. 
I really want to go to sleep but, you know, I'll just end up sleeping all day and then I'll be up all night again -- starts that cycle, you know? This is what happens when you go out drinking and then you have a really bad hangover the next day which makes you sleep all day. So, I think the lesson here is, don't go out and drink and get a hangover the next day, you know? Avoid the hangover. Maybe drink some V eight, I don't know. I mean, I usually don't get really get bad hangovers but for some reason --
Anyways, not much is new here. Still unemployed, you know, living the good life of being a bum and partying non stop while being a broke ass, then sleeping all day. Yep. So, um, I did have a job interview on Saturday. It went really well until they gave me a drug test. Yeah. Never had to do a drug test for a job before. It was just like that swab test where you keep that thing in your mouth for like a minute or so. So everything went great on the interview and then it was like, okay, we'll just give you a drug test. And I was, like, okay. You know, I can -- all like, everything's cool. I'm not a druggie -- which I'm not. I don't really do drugs anymore and I don't even smoke weed anymore. I quit. Up until like, last week, like I was totally clean, right? I haven't done anything in so long and I didn't even smoke. I don't smoke anymore. I smoke on -- or I smoked on New Year's Eve, like a little bit, and I didn't even like it, really. You know? I don't like that feeling. 
So, um -- yeah. Then last week, I, uh, was just at this party and my friend was like, oh, I'll buy you some pills and I was like, well, I haven't done it in so long, like a year and a half probably or more. So I was like, why not? If you're gonna buy it for me, why not? So, yeah -- and that was like a week ago, or last Friday, so like more than a week ago. 
And apparently, like, I looked up those -- those drug tests online -- the saliva ones? They can only tell the drugs that have been in your system for, like, three days or something -- three or four days. So it was a good, like, seven to eight days so maybe it will come out good. I mean, I really hope so, because I'm getting really sick of this whole being a bum thing. 
I mean, my car insurance expires today so no more driving for me unless I want to risk getting pulled over and getting a ticket for no car insurance and then I have to pay, like, so much money if I got a ticket which is totally not even worth it. 
So this just sucks, you know? But I should be finding out about that job, like -- what's to day? Tuesday? Tomorrow or Thursday. So I'm really hoping for that, you know? It was kind of a lame job. I would be a bagger at Safeway which is a grocery store . I'd be one of those baggers. Bag your food for you? Asking old ladies if they need help out to their car. I'd be that sad, miserable person pushing the carts around in the snow out of the parking lot. But hey, it's a job. 
Oh, right. Um, so this morning, I was sleeping, right? And don't ya freaking hate it when people call you when you're sleeping? Yeah, I do. So my friend calls me and I'm all sleeping, you know. I was so tired. So I grab my phone to hit Ignore and -- I don't know if you can see over there. There's like a coffee cup right over there on my nightstand. There's my bed. I'm sleeping there, you know? Yeah? And, uh, I hit Ignore and then put it on my nightstand -- goes right into the coffee cup. Yeah. I hear this, like, dunk and splash or whatever. So I'm like, oh, crap. So I reach in the coffee cup, and I pull it out, and I just like shook it off and then threw it on the floor. I didn't wake up to see like if it was all right, if it was broken, you know. I didn't give a shit. I just wanted to sleep. 
But it's all good, see? It's a little sticky. I didn't wash it off yet but it's good, no damage done. Score. Shit, I just called someone. Sorry. 
Anyways, I think that does it for my video. Once I find something interesting to talk about, maybe I'll make another one. All right.
