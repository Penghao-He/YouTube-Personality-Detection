Thought you'd never get to see this face again have you. Well, things haven't been that bad and things haven't been that good either. Mm, the bad part is that I have been homeless. The good part is that I got permanent housing, but I might have permanent housing again but in the place that I should of been in and shouldn't of been homeless. But, things are looking up in one way, but still haven't gone the way they should have gone. 
And because of the economy and things are changing, but you know what's going on out there just as well as I do. So, this is just a first of some of the videos that I can put out right now, um, because I got some of my stuff, so I can post this too you. I still got the same old set up, 'cause money's been tight, just like I know you have not had the money. But, been getting some new people subscribing, so here is the first of a couple of videos, I'm going to do this week. And, I'm going to rant and rave, uh, just fluff, just like I used to and just go, woah. 
Just like I looked good then I still look good, but the medication has changed somewhat for the better, but not good enough for me. So as far as work, they still haven't written anything consisive [sic. ] and I am still waiting on Social Security, 'cause right now they are just testing, testing, testing. And, I can't change doctors, 'cause I don't have the money. And hopefully congress can do something. 
I can't ask for Obama to do more that he's put out in a radio address, because it's not his -- it's his final decision, but it is still up to congress. And it's been their decision for the last ten years and they've just been sitting with their thumb up their butt waiting on the insurance companies. And, it's been their decision to tell us what to do when we're being giving them money and they've been going to the bank every day with our money. And, the only thing that we can do is just sit there and take it and we shouldn't be taking it. Same with the doctors, if we don't like the way the medication feels, don't take it. Sometimes you do have to live with the pain and I've been trying to do that for about the last two and a-half, almost three years. So, you're going to get here more bitching about pain and how I feel. So, that's the way it's going to be for me for a bit. But, other than that, this is the first of a few videos, just to tell you that I'm still here, so peace.
