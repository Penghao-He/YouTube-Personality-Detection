That is a subtle thing. Let me do it somewhere where it's more visible maybe. Um. Here. There. I like it. Um, yeah, it was on sale so I got it. Uh, yeah they have such crazy eye shadow colors. I bought, like, such boring ones because I'm bored. They have such nice ones like that amazing blue. Just check out the website. I think you can also order; no you can definitely also order. Otherwise there'd be not much point in me showing you all this. Um, they have really, really cool stuff. You have to see it. It's pretty amazing. 
Then, I got this which I love, I love, I love. This eyebrow marker. Um, it's kind of, like, a eyebrow pencil, but it's a marker. It's got, like, a kind of felt tip here and so it's the only thing I've ever found which is -- works at all. Got perfect that there's always one swipe. You know and I didn't smudge or anything. It's -- I got kind of semi permanent tattooey one. I love it. I love it, love it, love it. Just use it to, like, fill in places in my eyebrows. Okay, I don't have any spaces so there's nothing to fill in, but it's so good. And they have it in three different colors. One is for, um, brunettes and black haired people. One's for red heads. And one's for blondes. 
Sorry, I'm having problems breathing today. So, I love this. I was gonna buy this. Another thing I love, love, love is this, um, ultra tech mascara. This is so, so -- this is one of the best mascaras I've ever had. I bought it last year 'cause it was -- it was on sale. It wasn't on sale this year, but I still bought it. It's got a, like, tiny little brush with those tiny little bristles which usually isn't a good sign, but this mascara is really, really, really great. I can only recommend it. It's, like, good for everyday. It's not got too much volume. I don't really like that whole volume thing, but it's very, very lengthening and, um, clump and all and I think it's superb. It's really the best mascara I've ever tried. Okay, maybe not the best, but the best for the price at which comes. 
So, then I got this, um, eye shadow palette, whatever, set kind of thing called back to black. 'Cause I realized I never do smoky eyes and this might just be the perfect thing to do smoky eyes with. Well I thought it was, but let me explain in a second. So, here. It's got, like, different shades of grey and white and black. And I thought it would be really, really perfect, but, um, you'll see I do some swatches that -- I don't know. The colors aren't that great on, you know. Um, they are too sparkly so it's not really smoky eyes, it's just ridiculous. 
 I -- I do like the black; it's very, very good black. You can see; very highly pigmented. Um, but, like, uh, I can't really get it on here. You know -- this grey for example is so shiny. It's, like, sober. I -- I -- I don't enjoy that, no. Um, that was the darker grey and now the lighter grey. It's exactly like the darker grey. There's, like, no difference whatsoever. Actually, now that I look at it like that, there maybe, but it's very hard to see. In fact, this is the lighter one and this one actually looks lighter. This one's more silver, this one's more grey. I don't know. It's -- it's not -- you know. Um, then the white is, I guess, okay, but it's like, uh, too cold for -- you know, there are cold whites and there are warm whites and this is kind of a very icy, almost within, like, slightly blue tinge. I don't know if you can see that, but yeah. So, I'm not that happy with the palette even though it's, you know, it's pretty cool, it's got, like, a mirror and everything and then -- but, uh, I don't know if I'm really gonna find much use for that 'cause those colors also really don't suit me. So, yeah, I'm gonna have to look for someone doing the look with greys and blacks and whites; otherwise I'll have no idea how to do it anyway. 
Right. Then I got this, uh, lipstick. I don't -- I'm not sure which one it is. Color twenty two. They only have, like, two types of lipstick anyways so I don't know. And it's this, uh, very, very dark red. I shall do a swatch. My hand is getting kind of full here. I love it actually. It's the perfect pin up girl, Bettie Page red. You know, you'd think this was a really common color, but in most drug stores I've not been able to find that. This, like, nice, kind of berry, very wine, dark red, but, like, you could find it, but it's usually too dark and too, like, harsh and this one's still quite playful and cute. And also the lip liner, I bought one matching that. I'm not really into the darker and also it's been impossible to find a color like that. Now, I want it to be darker and then I'll blend them. I can -- actually, you know what, in the next video I'll, um, put the lipstick on so you can see the look. Yeah, and so I've done it like that; I think it's beautiful. Very, Betty Page pin up girl kind of thing. 
So, yeah, it's a great company with everything I got and, uh, I really, really, really love their stuff. I think it's, you know, it's almost there. It's not quite, I don' t think, up to the standards of, like, Mac and stuff and other professional companies even though it is a professional make up company. Um, but I think it's still very, very good so check out the website. I'll put it in the side and thank you for watching. 
Actually scratch that. Um, I forgot to say something. One part that I do not recommend by them is this soft color blush. Um, I have one from last year. I didn't buy one this year and it is terrible. It's so highly pigmented. I'm just, like, poking with the brush and I know it's a product brush so I got -- and look at this. I got this, uh, clown. Way too much. You know it's, like, impossible to apply it without looking ridiculous. So, I think, um, with blush also, um, the high quality is not only shown in the pigmentation, but also in how natural it looks and how, like, um, how easy it is to apply.
