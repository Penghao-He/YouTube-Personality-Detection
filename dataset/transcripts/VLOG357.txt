Hi. Um, I guess it's been a while, about a month or so since I made my last video, but I've done a lot of exciting things and I'm going to tell you what they are. 
I wrote a twelve page paper on bullying. I went to Niagara Falls, I saw a play in Niagara Falls. I went to a bird aviary. I went to Chicago. I loved Chicago. I learned about gangsters -- gangsters. I bought these pink sunglasses, went to Navy Pier. I went and saw a Stratford festival play. I performed in two plays in school. I graduated high school. Got a year book. I went to a formal. 
I went to the hospital like a million times for a rare disease called gall bladder disease. I got diagnosed with gall bladder disease. I have grown blue stones in my stomach. I need to get them surgically removed in the next two months. Yeah. 
I went and I bought lots of books. Let me just grab them. Lots of books, but I think that the most exciting thing that I've done is buy bulk fortune cookies. 
So I decided that today, just for you lucky viewer, that I'm going to open a fortune cookie in your honor and it will be your fortune for the rest of your life. XXXX. 
So your fortune is, ooh, you will be successful in your work. Good work. You're going to be successful. Congratulations. 
I really wanted to make this video not shitty because I've been gone for so long but yeah, if I ever disappear for like copious amounts of time again, I have a twitter that I update all the time and I have a daily boost that I update sometimes. I have a blog that I rarely update lately. I'm going to try and update it more, now that I'm basically done school. 
I'll just take a gander Neil's iPod. Let's see if I can find something good to listen to.
