Hey guys, it's me XXXX. How are you guys today? Today's video is just a quick blog. What, it's like July eighth or something, yeah July eighth. It's nine thirty in the morning, and um, Amy just done taking me over to the doctors. Just took in my, um, my paper work for a disability, is that what it was? My disability paper work. 
Doctor put me out of work for a while. Saturday I go in -- this Saturday the eleventh, I go in for my um, I'm not sure if it's going to be my epidural shots, or my epidural consultation. My neurologist seemed to think I really need this and it's up to the, you know, the guy actually giving me the shots whether he's going to do them or not. So, yeah, my doctor put me out for a little bit and, um -- and we'll see what happens. All right, I'll keep you guys posted over here on Louis' B logging but, not really much else to say. 
Um, you know what I do have one more thing to say. Amy just went over to, uh -- this is actually funny. We went over to -- what's the name of that place? 
Panera Bread
Panera Bread, aight. And of course you guys know, I got my coffee, right. Amy goes into Panera Bread and gets this drink. Who knew that the straws they give you from Panera Bread are that big? I mean, I hope -- I'm about to twitter this also, check the Twitter post -- but that straw is ama -- I mean that is huge. C'mon, I would say that's almost a half inch in diameter. I mean is it 'cause they want you to finish the drink that fast? It's not 'cause the drink is that thick, but I just thought I'd let you guys know. I mean, this thing is hilarious. Amy came out with that big ass straw and I just had to -- she says you twitter everything else, you gotta twitter the size of this damn straw. 
So I am. I'm going to go ahead and twitter that off, I think it'll be funny. Aight guys, that's pretty much it. I just wanna give you guys a head up on what's happening. Yes, I'm out of work for a while. Um, exactly how long, I don't know 'til my doctor gives me back this paper work he has to fill out for my work. And um, I'll keep you guys posted over here. All right, I'll definitely let you guys know what happens on Saturday when I get my shots -- and as always lots of love, lots of respect, alright? Peace.
