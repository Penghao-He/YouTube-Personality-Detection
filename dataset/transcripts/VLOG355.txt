Hi, XXXX. So you posed the question of which is worse, chickens that need chicken TV just to keep themselves from killing each other and hurting themselves or no chickens at all? Because if we stopped eating chicken that are raised in factory farms, they would probably go extinct because there are no more uh, chickens that were, you know, able to live in the wild. 
I think, as a vegetarian for the last year and a half, and as an animal rights person, that while it's a terrible option, chickens going extinct is probably better for the chickens. Because a life lived in captivity and in those horrible conditions is no better than having no life at all and as one of the commenters on your video said, a life that doesn't exist can't suffer. 
So as terrible as it sounds to say that I would prefer there be no chickens in the world because chickens are kind of cool. Um, it would be better for the chickens because they would not be suffering in the way that we make them suffer. 
I think that it's great that is person has found a way to lessen to the suffering of chickens in factory farms, because they really do suffer horrible, horrible tragedies like getting their beaks cut, and you know, being stuffed in cages where they can't even move. And they peck at themselves and each other and there's so much disease and disgusting things going on there. 
But I think the bigger issue is that we put these chickens in those deplorable conditions and we put lots of other animals like pigs, and cows, and sheep, and everything else that we eat just for ourselves in these terrible conditions just so we can feed ourselves in these vastly growing numbers. And I think we should try to find alternatives to that. 
So yes, in response to your -- your question, I do believe that it would be better for the chickens just to live out their lives without suffering and possibly go extinct. Because I think that people need to understand the consequences of what we do to the animals in our environment and to our environment itself. 
Because as my adorable little sticker says, they are not nuggets.
