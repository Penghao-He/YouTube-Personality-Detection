Yeah, let's just skip all the excuses and head straight to the sketch. So, the other day I was in New York before my class and I was thirsty, whatever, so I went and got a coffee at a deli -- where I at least tried to get a coffee at a deli. I went into the deli, tried to get this lady's attention, by saying excuse me, excuse me, how much is your coffee? And she was all -- so I told him, I'd better not see you with Kayla again or else I will cut you. So I continued to try and get her attention, excuse me, excuse me, right over here, right in front of your face. How much is your coffee? How much is it? Hello girl, I don't play around. Oh my God, girl, I was just thinking that. Holy shit! We're like twins or something. We can read each other's minds. I know, it's happened to me twice. 
Finally, after waving my hands in the air and making some loud noises, clapping, not really that loud, but you know what I mean, she finally answered. Oh, hold on, hold on, one second more, we got you know -- shit! It's one twenty five. Yeah, you're sure that person's not him. Yeah, Edgar . No, no ho ho, blondish kind of. Girl, don' t you dare dye your hair blond, no. So I'm standing there, taking it, as her and her friend on the phone make fun of me in front of my face and then try and say okay, I'll have a coffee please, and she's still not answering. She's still straight up ignoring me even though she's looking at me and picking out my flaws and telling them to her friend. Oh, I should've . 
Please, it's always the same. The carpet matches the rug. Look at Lindsay Lohan. I know. What happened to her? She's done . My God, I saw like a rainbow. Finally, she noticed that I was doing this again and she did this. Ha, alright I'll -- hold on. Yeah, yes it's back. That'll be a dollar twenty five. Yeah, look, no, shut up girl. Oh my God! You didn't, you didn't. So the manager, who I guess was there the whole time in the back, comes to the front of the counter, whatever, and I try to be, you know, witty and straight up tell him that his employees suck and they say I guess she got an important phone call and he just does this. Just stared, just stared at me like I was in the wrong, after his employee rudely, like, wasted five minutes of my life when I could've got a coffee that quickly -- like this. Geez, I mean it's a store. I'm sorry for interrupting your conversation about cutting people, but I just wanted to purchase a coffee, since this is a deli and that's what you do, you know. Gosh, New Yorkers, as if you don't have a bad reputation already. 'Til next time folks, I'll see ya in a month. No, hopefully not. Bye.
