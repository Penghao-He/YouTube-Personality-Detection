Ooh --
Fire, so burn and feed it. 
No, that's -- that was like the only good thing I did throughout the whole game. Another sexist stereotype: only gay guys can be cheerleaders. 
Hey. Okay, so I'm going to get straight to the point 'cause um, I don't have time to do my usual intro -- whatever. 
Ha ha. Rup, rup, rup, rup. It's long --
So, now what I was going to say? Right, so the difference between guys and girls. What can girls do that guys can't do and what can guys do that girls can't do? If that makes sense. 
So first off, sexual jokes. When a guy says a sexual joke, it's gross, but hilarious, right? Because that's how guys are. They're gross and hilarious, but when a girl says a sexual joke, it's just gross. And depending on how vulgar the sexual joke is, it can even make her look like a slut. And it sucks, too, because I know a lot of hilarious sexual jokes, but, you know, I'm just not in the mood to be a ho bag right now. 
Another thing um, guys have it easy when they need to go to the bathroom. And you know what I'm talking about. Okay, so one time my cousin went on a field trip and it was a long bus ride. There was no bathroom on the bus and the bus driver didn't want to make a quick stop. And his friend who's a guy had to piss so bad. He had to piss so bad that his bladder had gas. No, his bladder didn't really have gas. Just a metaphor I made up to show you how bad he needed to piss. All right, so he needed to pee so bad and lucky for him, he had an empty water bottle with him. Yeah, this is a little weird and awkward, I guess, buy hey! He did it, you know? Uh, a girl can't do that. 
Basically, guys can just pee anywhere. They can pee in the bushes, the trees, pinecones, whatever, you know? I mean, I guess girls can do that too, but we don't really like squatting in public. Maybe for yoga, but not -- huh uh, no. And then, toilet paper. You expect us to use a leaf? No, okay? There could be ladybugs one that thing. You know, roly polies, or whatever? That's -- that's yucky. 
What can girls do that guys can't do? Um, we can give birth and go through menustration -- woo hoo! Okay, so I'm not going too in depth about menustration because I know a lot of guys feel uncomfortable talking about or even hearing the word menustration -- menustration -- menustration. But you know what? Suck it up, buttercup. The words men and straight are in menustration for a reason because you straight men need to suck it up, too. And that's what she said. 
And uh, guys can't give birth either. Aw, shucks. Yeah, guys are never going to know what it feels like to give birth unless they have fallopian tubes or something. 
Okay, last thing. Uh, sex and stereotypes. That stereotype that girls suck at sports or girls can't play football --
See, short guys can be cheerleaders, too. All right, well I gotta go 'cause it's spring break and I'm supposed to go to a barbecue. I can't leave, though, until I finish my laundry and I have freaking like three baskets of laundry that I need to do and fix my bed and everything and -- I'm procrastinating. 
I'll right, so I guess I'll TTYL.
