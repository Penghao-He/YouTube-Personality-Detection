Hello. Um, I'm learning guitar, and this is a song that I love that I decided to try to cover, so. It's called "Company, " by An Horse and sorry about the lighting, I don't know, so --
Please put on that record again. And I will put on that shirt you've been wearing around. You've been wearing around / It's times like this I think too much. Times like this I think too much. Oh, please don't think too much. 'Cause I can't let you in. 'Cause these walls have been built. No, I can't let you in. 'Cause these walls have been built. But you said I'm out on a ledge. Come stand with me. I need the company. I need the company. My face has turned red, but it's not from something you just said. No, I'm blushing on inside. It's those damned green eyes. And panel by panel and piece by piece. This all fits together, but it's not what you think. There I go again. There I go again. You said I'm out on a ledge. Come stand with me. I need the company. I need the company. I'm trying to get you in. I'm trying to get you over. And I'm trying to get you in. I'm trying to get you over, and I'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to be brave. Come with me to every word. And I'm saying I'm trying not to give it away. I like to keep my cards so close. Keep that cunt so long. And all my broken heart. And all my forgettable false starts. Well you can come right now, but you'd better not look away. You can have 'em right now, but you better not look away. This is me trying to be brave. You can have 'em right now. You better not look away. This is me trying to be brave.
