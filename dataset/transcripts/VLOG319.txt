Hey, YouTube. Um, so I haven't been making a video for a very, very, very long time and, um, I just didn't feel like it and then this thing happened and well, nothing interesting happened actually or nothing that you guys should know, so yeah. 
Um, I think five and I can't remember how many times. Well, that was actually, um, an answer to a question, um, someone's, uh, screen name which I can't pronounce in English, which will be right here somewhere. Um, well his question was, with how many guys did you make out and with how many times with each guy? Well, um, yeah, nothing been going on and, um, I don't have any ideas anymore, so this kind of bad, and, um, yeah, I -- I just don't know what I should say actually. 
Um, today I went shopping and, um, I was with my mom which is kind of, I don't know, weird and, um, these two guys were walking past me and one just says, like Emo, and I'm like, why do you have to call me Emo? Just, um, 'cause I'm wearing, like that kind of clothes. I don't get it. So, yeah, I mean, my clothes aren't that Emo, it's all right though. 
Well, I was just like, 'cause I bought new clothes just like yesterday, so you just have to wear them immediately. That's -- that's what I have. When I buy new stuff I immediately want to wear it, straight away. I just want to wear it and it doesn't matter if it doesn't match. Well it does, actually, but have to wear 'em in the house or something; I just want to try them out, but, um, nothing has been going on. 
Do you notice that I turn my head around in that last bit? But whatever. Um, do you have any ideas you people should send me something or I don't know. Well I have thirty subscribers. Yeah, thirty and I'm pleased. I really like that, so yeah. Um, I'm just gonna, I don't know, surf on the internet. 
I wanna -- I wanna -- I have some new shoes which I'm really psyched about, so just have to show them, so, um, I'll be back in a sec, I won't be that long, okay? Bye. 
Okay, I'm back, and, um, while I was, um, running downstairs, um, to get my shoes I saw the ice cream man. I saw the ice cream man standing there, so got myself some ice cream. So now I'm going to be eating during this video. 
There. Um, I got these, which I'm really psyched about. There the shoelaces aren't supposed to go like this, but I just, I like it like this, so, yeah. A friend of mine has them and I really, really, really love them, so I bought them as well . I hope she doesn't mind. 
Um, yeah, I really don't have anything to talk about, so just going to, I don't know, eat this ice cream and speed it up. 
. Oh, oh. You're so good to me baby, baby. 
Oh my God, brain freeze. 
I want to lock you up in my closet, when no one's around. I wanna put your hand in my pocket, because you're allowed. I wanna drive you into the corner, and kiss you without a sound. I wanna stay this way forever, I'll say it loud. Now you're in, and you can't get out. You make me so hot. 
Well I haven't finished my ice cream yet, but I'm getting, like, a brain freeze and this is taking eleven minutes already, so, yeah, I think you guys probably getting bored anyway. 
Um, XXXX why did you delete your account, I was so -- I so aah! You know, that your videos were like not as enthu -- bleh, bleh -- enthusiastic. Um, I really, really like them 'cause I know you, you know, so yeah. Come on, please come back, I really, really, really want you back, 'cause, I don't know, but I know you're busy and stuff, so yeah. 
Um, well I have been doing lately is just like watching videos on YouTube and, um, you guys, all know them, like . Charlie is so cool like. Pear shaped, sixty eight, Jimmy -- Jimmy zero zero ten, five thousand guys. What about Adam Devonks . The name is Kye Debeweller , keep the PJ and Smash. So yeah, they're like pretty awesome and, um, yeah, those are the ones who like, I've seen make videos a lot, so yeah. 
Um, what do you guys think about Ben and Jerry's ice cream? I think it's delicious. So that was just a question that popped up because I'm eating ice cream, so yeah. Um, answer it in the comment box thingy. Sorry I'm not familiar with the names, especially not in English, so yeah. 
Um, I'll see you guys later. Oh, by the way, this is my last day with my internet, 'cause, um, in two weeks I have this exam week again and um, well this one is like, the most important one, so, um, I have to learn for that. 
Well my mom told me to. So yeah, I'm pretty bummed. 
So yeah, see you in two weeks hopefully. Bye.
