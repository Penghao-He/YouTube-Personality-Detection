Inglorious Bastards, the new Quentin Tarantino movie that came out on Friday, but I saw it on Saturday, why? Because, I'm bad ass. So, I kind of figured I'd do a review right now, but I'd like to add in that it is one in the morning. So, if this is not the greatest review, it's because I'm freaking tired. Anyway, let's get started. 
So, the main thing that attracted me to this movie was the fact that it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, and I'm a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. Um, right now I'd just like to say, em, it was he -- did a very good job in the film, it was all well done, stuff like that. Um, but I wouldn't say it was his best film, because a lot of people out there are saying that this is one of -- this is his best film he's ever made. I beg to differ; it was Reservoir dogs, just saying. But it is indeed one of his better films that he has made, so just throwing that out there. 
Now, let's get off with some of the goods and the bads. So, one of the things I loved in this movie was, Brad Pitt's acting. Because his accent was -- it -- his accent added humor, and is just a really good accent, and you know, his -- he made the movie funny, but also was -- he did -- really actiony and stuff like that. Um, kind of jumbled up right there, but his acting in general, he was great in it. That also leads to one of those -- those flaws, and to me, it seemed like he didn't have that much screen time, because you see him for about ten minutes, and then you don't see him again for another half hour. Um, he probably had about fifty minutes screen time -- I -- I can't remember how long the movie is, I know it's at least two hours. But, I know it's a good thing sometimes when you don't see the star that much, because it adds, you know, more screen time for people that are unknown, and stuff like that, but, um, with his acting -- when his acting is that great, you kind of want to see him more, I guess. So, ah, that's just one thing. 
Um, one of the other good things about this movie was the screen transitions. Like, it wasn't just a bunch of random stuff happening, but the screen transitions were well placed, they were well laid out, and stuff like that. Um, that also kind of led to something else, like, um, a really good, good scene would happen -- um, I don't want to spoil too much, -- but like a really actiony scene would happen, but then it would jump into the next scene, and the next scene would be kind of boring; not that great. Um, but, some of the scenes were stretched out, like, there was unneeded dialogue, nothing really important happened. Um, for example, this is a minor spoiler for people out there, the tavern scene where they're, um, all, dressed up like Nazi's and talking to that -- um, one of the in command guys for the Nazi army, um, like, maybe five seconds of the entire scene were important to the -- to the rest of the movie, but the rest of the stuff was just thrown in there, not really needed, like, they spent thirty minutes taking about random stuff, and then another thirty minutes playing a game, and, I -- I found it kind of boring, and I had to, like, I almost, kind of, fell asleep during that scene. But trust me, it's worth it to watch it, if you've seen the movie already. If not, go see it, but that comes later. 
Um, another good thing I liked, and I keep saying that -- it's been kind of repetitive, but whatever -- um, was the chapter format. Like, it's like -- it's basically, like, literally, a moving book, because it'll say chapter one, and then at the end of that chapter, you'll see chapter two and stuff. And I just thought that was kind of cool, because it's like, kind of like a book, and that -- that -- that goes back to the screen transitions, because it was like, you're just flicking through a book and reading it. That's -- I liked it. I'm probably weird, but yeah. 
Um, going back to Brad Pitt's acting though, the humor in this movie was, great. It was well placed too; there wasn't too much humor and there wasn't too less humor -- if that makes sense? Um, Brad Pitt's character was the funniest, but a lot of one liners came from other characters during really serious moments, so if you're really tensing up and feeling that something's going to happen, there's going to be at least one, good, one liner that's thrown in there that makes the movie funny. It's kind of like a dark comedy, because it's kind of hard to make World War Two funny and all the Jewish stuff that's going on. But -- yeah, the humor -- like I said, the humor was good. 
They, um, actually I thought this was more of a humorous film than an action film, and that's kind of saying a lot, being that it's a war -- it's a war movie, but --
Um, so this --this-- this is one of Brad Pitt's greatest movies -- that's what I think, but I haven't really seen a lot of his movies, but it's definitely his greatest film in the last five years, at least. Um, but moving on. 
Um, this one is just a bad thing, um, the subtitles, because three -- um, French is used in the movie, German's used in the movie, and obviously English is, but he had to use German and French subtitles, um. The subtitles were good, but it's like, they'll be speaking French, and then the subtitles -- if they say, like, merci or Mademoiselle, they'd actually put down those words, they wouldn't say -- they wouldn't put what they actually mean in English. But then sometimes they did, so it's kind of confusing, because sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. And I just thought that was kind of weird, maybe they could have worked on that just a little bit more, but yeah. 
So, like I said, fantastic movie, I really loved it. Um, final rating, I would give it A-. It's a really good movie; I really recommend you go see it, right now. It's not as gory as you think it would be, but hey, it attracted me, so take a look at it guys. It's definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's best works, so, yeah, that concludes my one in the morning review. 
I'm going to get some freaking sleep. Goodbye.
