Happy Thanksgiving or Turkeyday, whatever you want to call it. I wanted to make a quick little video to say what I'm thankful for this year. I'm grateful for babies in highchairs, soft pillows, babies in strollers, harmonicas, and chalk on sidewalks. I'm grateful for Tap the Jump Drip, dream catchers that keep away nightmares, for lighthouses, black and white photographs, and Chai tea -- as long as it doesn't burn my tongue. I'm grateful for people who make me laugh and people who make me smile, and people who smile. I'm grateful for socks that give me room to wiggle my toes, for memories, hummingbirds, for thrift shops and flea market, for keys that don't have locks. I'm grateful for dogs that don't growl and for cats that purr. I'm grateful for boys who act their age. I'm grateful for love. I'm grateful for everything really. I just don't think that I realize it.
