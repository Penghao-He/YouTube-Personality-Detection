Bypathway House is for children when they reach six to eighteen so that they learn the skills they need to become a functioning member of society. We give these children a chance to be adults. So kids who come from Russia, but Russia is part of the USSR and part of communism and part of the Soviet Union, and so these statistics are through the entire area. 
On the first of January, two thousand and three, there were as many as eight hundred sixty seven thousand and eight hundred orphans in Russia alone. Only ten percent of the orphans are the result of the death of their parents. The other ninety percent are social orphans. Their parents simply abandoned them. 
About fifteen thousand children leave Russian orphanages each year once they are eighteen years old. Of these five thousand are employed, six thousand are homeless, around three thousand resort to crime, and approximately fifteen hundred commit suicide. Roughly half the girls end up in prostitution. There is a video of the Chernobyl Children's Project International has done, which would be right here, so click on that for more information. It shows what they do and it explains how they go about . 
The test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer. 
In nineteen ninety one, the Soviet Union ended, which meant that a whole bunch of countries had to figure out how to be a government on their own. Seventeen years later, those countries are still struggling. There's a lot of things that need to happen for these countries to be as efficient and as good as they can be, and there's a lot of these things that will take a lot of time for it to happen. And it's not something you can throw money at and it's not something that you can go in and fix in one day. There needs to be a full renovation of the government, which people are resistant to. 
This charity especially focuses on disabled children, because they're the most neglected in former Soviet countries. Often, if a child is disabled, simply even being blind or deaf, they'll be put into a mental institution. The country's children are suffering because of it. The charity I want to support and mention is called the Chernobyl Children's Project International and it's for countries that were affected by the Chernobyl disaster in nineteen eighty six. Because of Chernobyl, a lot of radiation was put into that area, which caused a lot of birth defects in children and a lot of problems for the people that live there. These places do not provide therapy. These places provide a meal and a bed. Many of the children in these institutions are unable to speak because no one has taught them to speak. No one talks to these children. 
Chernobyl Children's Project International goes in.
