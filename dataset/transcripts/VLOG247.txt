Oh, hi there internet. Aha. How are you doing? I am fine. Yeah. I just want to tell you a little story about something that happened to me this afternoon that I found quite weird and strange and very much shareable, if that's a word or it's just something I'd like to share with you. Let's put it that way, because I'm a sharer, if that's even a word. But, if there was such a word as sharer, I am one, because I like to share crap that happens to me. Moving on. 
See I have this book, but it's not my book. I'm sure it's a fantastic book, um, but it's not mine and the owner left it at our place and I wanted to send it back to the owner today, because I'm a nice person and that's what nice people do. They send books back to the people that own them. Right? Yeah. 
So, I went to the post office, because this is a nice book. I mean, I'm -- I can show it back to you again. It's a nice book, it's a hardcover book and, um, I don't have, like, a ton of boxes that I could just use or -- I didn't want to wrap it up in some stuff and just, you know, send it and wish myself good luck that it gets there in one piece and then, you know, leave it at that. No, no, no. I thought, hey, go to the post office; get a nice little package thing for the book and, you know, write a few words then send it back to the person that, uh, the book belongs to. 
Now, I don't know what kind of experiences you guys have had, but post offices, so far, like mine all have been rather negative, but today topped everything I've ever seen happening in a post office. So, I took that book and went to the next post office. I entered and it was amazing. I've never seen so many people waiting in line to send their crap to other people. I've never, never seen anything like it, seriously. And, there are only three people working, so it was really, really -- it was really slow process going on, really slow process. 
But, I thought, okay, you know? I have my iPhone. I can listen to music and I can check my emails and I can read things on Twitter. I'm good. I'm good. Only problem is when there are so many people in one tiny room and they're all wrapped up in their winter clothing, they tend to sweat and, unfortunately, stink. So it was -- just -- arrgh -- the air in there was just disgusting. The air was smelling like sweat and warm clothing, you know, like, the wool thing tends to smell sometimes. 
And, um, breath, not only just breath, you know, like, a room filled with people that were wearing clothes, and they're sweating and talking to each other or breathing in general. And to me I don't -- I'm not so good with a lot of people in a tiny space. I tend to get nauseous and that was just, you know, the whole temperature thing. It -- it was not a really good combination. 
And to top that off, I'm standing there, in line, waiting for about 60 minutes and I didn't even get half way through the entire line. But, I was thinking, you know what? Calm down; you've got time, you don't need to hurry up. It's gonna be your turn eventually. 
So, after sixty minutes a boy at the age of -- I'd say four or maybe five -- that was also waiting in line with his mother, I guess, um; he was standing, like, two meters next to me and all the sudden he threw up on the floor out of nowhere. It was probably not out of blue for him, but for me it was. It was, like, this explosion of thrown up things on the floor and then there were people and more people and the mother and she was all, like, oh no. And the boy was, like, crying and it was horrible. And the smell -- oh God, the smell -- and it was disgusting. 
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm one of those people that's not, just like, oh well, there is someone who is throwing up, doesn't concern me. No. If I see, hear and smell someone throwing up right next to me, it does concern me, because it's kinda sickening. And I'm, like, no, I don't want to be here. Can you please stop throwing up? I don't wanna look, but I have to. I don't wanna look, I have to. Oh God, I can smell him. It doesn't matter if I look or not. 
You know, right after that happens, my mood kinda went like this. It was just bleah; it was nasty and I just wanted to go home. And I was so annoyed, so, you know, I thought, oh, I'm gonna have to stand here for another hour. Really? Just because of a freakin' book? No. So I was frustrated and mad and annoyed, and I just went home and took a shower. Because, I felt really gross. That was just a really nasty afternoon and I just wanted to get that off. I just really wanted to get that off me, uch, it was, ooh, fuck, because I could've waited longer and just sent the damn book back. But, at that moment -- at that very moment, I did not think that far. 
And, I'm sitting here thinking do post offices even open Saturdays?
