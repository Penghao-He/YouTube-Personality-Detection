And then fill this one out for dinner, a little pepper, you whip it, and have a great salad. Delicious. 
So, I kind of want to show you, um, a bit, about what it took to make the desktop that I made for my blog. I always make a desktop every month and I thought I'd show you a bit of behind the scenes. Um, it looks like it's all, like, hand drawn and it is all hand drawn, but a lot of the work and the composition is put together in Photoshop. 
So, I'll show you each of individual drawings. That's the main and it's just all done in pen. And little frowny bits, nothing special and then the flowers that went behind them. See, all I did was scan them all in and, uh, get rid of the background and Photoshop, and apply a couple of textures that I have and actually also did just a plain wash sort of background behind it and, um, yeah, that's how I made it. 
Sounds like it just took just five minutes, but it didn't. It took quite a few hours actually. Um, yeah, it's very you like it and I like making them for you. It kind of pushes me and helps me find new techniques for things and how I wanna draw basically in my old career, I guess. Uh, so, I'm glad that people give me the opportunity to do and then they don't totally hate them. 
You have a great night, great day and see you. 
﻿Um, there was also Nigel B. Canon's work which was great and also Courtney Broone . She does the most beautiful, like, little pencil drawings. They're really amazing when you get to see them up close. So --
