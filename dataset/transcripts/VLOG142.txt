There have been some requests. Um, my family continues to support my addictions, um, which is probably a good thing. Okay, the gambling one is probably not a good thing, and, uh, nobody got me a, uh, you know, like a really nice bottle of Scotch this year but I did again get a -- a -- a gift certificate to converse. com and, uh, people wanted to see what the new ones looked like and so I'm here to share, um, and then whenever the other -- this is one A and one B, whenever two A and two B show up, uh, you'll get to see those too, but, uh, the first pair, Sudoku shoes. It's all squares, it's all numbers. It's kind of terrifying. The other pair, I believe were based on, uh, Rodney Dangerfield's pants and Caddyshack. Um, I ordinarily don't wear plaid. This is the first, uh, piece of plaid I've ever owned. Um, it's not the most irritating pair of chugs I own but it's, uh, it's pretty close. You know, um, it's not limeade and it's not my -- my now infamous among the students. Do you get my tie dyes? My infamous amongst the students, uh, white -- this is the hate half. There is also one that, uh, says love so they know which foot I'm going to kick them with. Um, I guess this is, uh, this should cover, uh, pretty much what everyone cared about. Um, so let's leave it at that. My shoes. Sadly this is in fact the life of dub. Uh, I am now five pairs away from being able to wear a different pair of chugs on every day of the month. One in February.
