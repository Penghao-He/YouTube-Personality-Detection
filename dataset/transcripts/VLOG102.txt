They had -- don't have any food - maybe more -- I don't know -- oy. Start, start, start the fire. Come on, come on, let . Start, start, start the fire. What you waiting for now? Start, start, start the fire. Come on, come on, let it out, . Start, start, start the fire. I know you're never gonna wanna stop. Yeah. 
Hey guys. So no new news has come out yet, for at least myself, about auditioners all chat. I know I'm still waiting and so are a lot of people that I auditioned with in Ann Arbor and a lot of my b fan friends. So hold out for us. We're hoping that we get, um, character performer. So that'll be fun. 
But I know I keep getting yelled at, like I'm nervous about waiting for character performer results. But everybody's like, it doesn't matter, you're already in the program, you're already going down, you have attractions so what's there to be worried about? So not much new, well yeah. 
So nothing new's been going on with me. We're chilling at school right now. Um, the semester's crazy busy, coming to a close. There's half a week this week 'cause this week's Thanksgiving, then all week next week and then I only have like three finals. So I only have finals on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and that's if I have my final on Thursday. I hope not. That would be awesome. 
I am, uh, really excited for the semester to be over. I'm sad but I'm happy. I mean I'm sad because it means that I'm not gonna see anybody that I see at school all the time anymore. I only have two -- just under two -- well just about two weeks, uh, to see them, left. So they haven't scheduled times to get together with me so I guess they don't care. Ouch. 
Seven weeks until I am in Florida. I will be in Florida -- in Orlando -- seven weeks from today. I leave in forty seven days, I think. I leave the Saturday before my check in. My check ins January thirteenth, if I can't say that enough. And it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm really excited for my trip down. Um. I'm going with a certain somebody. I don't know who. You might. I don't know. Do you know this guy? 
Probably, because I'm there. 
Yeah. 
I'm there. I'm there. Yeah. 
Yes. I am driving down hopefully. We're -- we're still caravanning. I mean I don't know if he's changed plans on me again. Last I talked to him -- for the last two weeks we've been talking about caravanning down. We're both driving our cars so Ran and I are going to caravan down to Florida. So we're leaving Saturday. Again it's Wednesday. So we're gonna go either to Disney or Universal or Sea World or something or just chill in Orlando for a couple days. That'll be fun. 
And then on Wednesday when we check in or Tuesday night if you go to the dinner, um, last I heard the dinner is -- uh -- going to be at the Ale House I believe. If not there I think it's B. Dobs if it hasn't been decided. I'm really excited. 
Also -- um -- for December twenty first, it scares me. These three guys have been planning a Disney CP get together. And you know who they are. You don't name names but if I must name names they are three -- well -- infamous waters. Uh, we'll go here, we'll go here, and we'll go here. Will, Ryan, and John. They have started planning a CP Past, Present, Future get together in the windy cindy -- win -- windy. In the windy -- in Chicago. It's under the Bean -- I guess is where we're gonna meet. We're gonna meet by the Bean in Chicago. If you don't know what the Bean looks like, here's a picture. I went like two years ago. That's my Bean picture. We are meeting in Chicago and it's supposed to be Monday, December twenty first from two to five. 
If you live in the area and want to go, message one of the boys. I will put it in my sidebar, how to get a hold of them. Um, those are their blogs so you can just go message them through YouTube and let them know that you either have ideas for going -- um -- or -- well ideas for things to do. If you want to go, here's the event link. I'll put that over there too. There's the sidebar. There's -- so you can go there. And it's -- it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun. So far there's like 10 or 12 people that are going. And I'm excited because it's a lot the people that I know or that I can't wait to meet. So I've already met XXXX and XXXX, as you know. 
I love this. I wish we had a camera -- a stack of cameras. 
If you didn't know already, I met XXXX and XXXX. John's gonna be there, John XXXX. I'm very excited to meet Nick. We've been talking since May. So that'll be fun. Who else is going? Ashley lives like forty minutes away from me. And if she actually goes then her and I are going to carpool. So that'll be a fun road trip hanging out with her down I think the twentieth or twenty seventh for the CP. We live forty minutes away and we'll both be down in Florida together. 
And there's a couple other people. Um, I heard my roommate Mandy is coming up with her mom. So that makes me really excited. I get to see her -- bottom up -- before we arrive. And then I hope my roommate -- I nicknamed all of them -- will be there. She hasn't said if she's going or not. to talk about it. I hope she's going to be there too. That'll be fun to see her again. So it'll be a nice little mini reunion. Um, a mini meet -- in -- ahead of time I guess -- to meet all of these people. And it's going to be a lot of fun. So see the sidebar if you want to go. 
And other than that I'm still waiting for results and -- oh, um, everybody knows this but Space Mountain opened today I guess. Yeah. It's today. Toss some Disney news in there. They've been doing soft openings all week and finally opened. Disney -- there -- there's some really cool videos about, uh, the parks that have been posted on YouTube. Uh, one is about them setting up all the Christmas decorations in the front of Magic Kingdom so sidebar will have that link. 
I was tipped off yesterday -- I know I'm stealing his thunder and he'll kill me for it later if he watches my blogs. I was told yesterday by Nick that -- all about the mouse pod cast on iTunes -- what were pod casts -- yeah -- about the mouse pod casts that's on iTunes -- whatever. That's how I found it. Did an episode this week where they talked about the CP. I started listening to it. It's about twenty minutes into the pod cast that they actually get to the CP portion and it involves one of the skippers. That's -- that's pretty cool. You can go listen to that. Um, I'll give details so you'll remember in the sidebar. I think that's it. This is a pretty long blog. Other than that I'm really excited. Uh, two weeks left in the semester. Seven weeks -- spend time in Florida. I'm already packing as you can tell. This used to have a bunch of pictures behind it. And this wall had all these pictures and they're all packed. They're all gone. I packed my summer clothes, my closet. I'm packing more -- um -- well soon more packing instead of doing homework. I have a lot of homework to do too. That's bad. So -- but I am going to go and I hope everyone has a magical day. And we'll see you real soon.
