For this year's project for awesome I've chosen to talk about Tom's shoes. Tom's Shoe's is a shoe company that employs a one for one philosophy. For one pair of shoes you buy, they donate one pair of shoes to a child in need. One for one. Tom's has made drops in South Africa, Argentina, Ethiopia and even in America and altogether they've donated over a hundred and fifty thousand shoes to kids that don't have them. They're really comfortable, they're made of cloth so once you break them in, they're your shoes and they fit really well on your feet. They have really thick, good soles. The shoes that you get are the same shoes that the kids get so if you order a pair of Tom's and you're happy with the quality of the shoes, then what you're wearing on your feet is what a kid, who didn't have shoes before, will be wearing on their feet. They come in lots of cool styles. They have glitter shoes. They have rap boots now. They have lace up shoes if you don't like the slip on ones. If you interested in learning more about Tom's, there's a link in the side bar, check out and happy project for awesome .
