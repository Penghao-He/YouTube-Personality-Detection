I've had so much fun with this and if I write something in Norwegian, it will read it as if it's English so it sounds pretty ridiculous. Like this. 
And that meant I'm trying to write something in Norwegian but the voice reads this in English and it was supposed to say, . What's the difference? 
It's not the same law. And second, I want to apologize for my late video updates but I didn't have my computer this summer and my camera, I thought it was broken but I figured out I could film with it anyway so, um, hopefully I'll be making How to be Norwegian Lesson Two, very soon so stay tuned. Stay strong and stay tuned so, um, yup, goodbye. 
This is the end of the video. Goodbye.
