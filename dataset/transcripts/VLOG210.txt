Hi. What up guys? I'm doing pretty good, just chilling. Oh, what's this? Huh, nothing, just my sixty caliber, you know. Going to put this away, if you don't mind. Huh, okay. . So there a few things I want to talk about with you guys today. First thing, save Jesus from the dragons . Do it now. 
Okay, second thing, it was recently brought to me by this black guy that . So it was recently brought to me by a buddy of mine Lamar that as of late my videos have been slightly different. And to be honest, I agree with him. This is not necessarily a negative thing. But I have seen a change over the last few months. In my opinion, my videos have become a tad bit too repetitive and a little bit dull at times. I mean you guys still seem to like them. But who cares, you guys are douche bags. I'm kidding guys. Wow, I'm kidding. I'm sorry. All I'm saying guys, is that I kind of want to go back to the way it used to be before, when I enjoyed the finer things in life, like going down to the beach on Sundays and slapping chimpanzees. You know, good times. So yeah, now I'm just going to try do something different in my videos. Look at last month when I moved away from your mom to your dad, huh. What's moving on? 
Third thing. In my last video I mentioned that I was going to be getting a Mac Pro in a week and it was just like care bears, fun. That obviously didn't happen yet. Mostly because my Mac decided to take a dump on my face, two girls went top style. Gross, yeah. Basically my being cancelled and my Mac won't be arriving until the sixth of August. 
Which brings us to our fourth point. Currently today until the date of fourteenth of August, which means no Mac until the fourteenth. However, fear not I'll still try make videos whilst I'm here so, awesome.
