Man. New fucking York. New York State Senate voted down the Gay Rights Bill that has been trying to get through the state senate for like five fucking years. Really? Really, New York? That's gonna be your bit? Gonna be your thing? Oh God, fuck. New York politics could just get me in a fucking rage. I don't even live there anymore and I'm just fucking livid. 
All I'm gonna do is sit around and crisps for the rest of the day, that's all I'm gonna do. Aww fuck, shit, God damn all day. All I'm going to do. And there goes a perfectly good day. It's nice outside and stuff, but I can't enjoy it. New York, I'm looking at you. It's not fucking fair. And, uh just, God, this is kinda bad. It's been a bad couple of years for gay marriage. I mean, there's been some progress, yeah, but you know, New York and California, aah, it's just fucking bullshit.
