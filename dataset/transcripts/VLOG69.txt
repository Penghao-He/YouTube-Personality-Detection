XXXX, from Japan. Tomorrow, I'm headed to Niigata, the reason why? I will write for Japan Pro Events . The company sent us an offer, hey, come to Niigata, we'll comp you for everything. In return, blog about it. 
Well, since I'm a blogger and I blog almost every day, that's a pretty good deal. So, I'm heading off tomorrow and um, I'm gonna stay at a bunch of different places, um, just beautiful places and do all kinds of interesting activities, eat lots of food and I'm gonna blog about it every day, so please visit my personal blog and then at the end I will gather up the links to all the posts and put them onto the Japan , because let's face it, the company would like more hits than just from my personal blog. 
So, and I'll also have a companion from another Japan website. So I'll try to put some links to her stuff too, and you can see why you should go to Niigata. I'm pretty sure you should like, 'cause it's awesome. 
And speaking of awesome, my snowboarding, this weekend will not be awesome and I might die, so if the blogging stops abruptly, you'll know why. But, for the time being, visit while I'm still alive. The producers would like you to know that while snowboarding is dangerous for Clay , it's safe and luxurious if you're a good person that would like to come to Niigata, so yeah, don't take Clay's death as a sign that you shouldn't go to Niigata. It's awesome.
