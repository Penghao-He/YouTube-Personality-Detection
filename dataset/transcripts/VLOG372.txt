Guess what? I got a hair cut. Yeah, it's amazing. Um, it was getting really hard to control so I had to cut it, but luckily it grows back, so I -- I think I'll have it -- it'll be back soon enough. 
Look, I bought a book today. Um, it's called Odd Hours by Dean Koonst and I -- l think it will be a good book. So far from what I can tell it's about some kid who goes to California and doesn't find what he wants. Like every other book, that there's a kid that goes somewhere and does find what he wants. 
I also bought new Post it notes because I'm starting to run out and it turns out that the ones that are in color are actually cheaper than the ones that are all yellow, which I was going to buy all yellow ones. My wall over here that I keep a lot of notes on is starting to full -- to be full so. And I bought some new ones. And look, I also realized yesterday I have a book called The War of the Worlds, but look at this it is the unabridged -- I don't know if you can see that -- unabridged version. That's what the little word says. It's unabridged, yeah. That means that it's, like, the first -- that's the way it was when it first came out. It's amazing. So yeah. 
I have bad news though. My computer had a little clasp on it and I had to send my computer in to get it fixed by Dell. So that's going to suck. Um, but when it get's back it will be awesome. So I have to send it off sometime within the next two weeks so I can get it back before I go to college. 
And um, that's about it, so see ya later. 
PS -- Um, Andrew I need to still get those books from you so if you could call me and we could somehow get the books before you leave on Friday for college, that would be awesome. 
So uh, bye.
