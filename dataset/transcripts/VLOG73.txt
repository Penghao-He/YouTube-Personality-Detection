Hello Youtube. I know I haven't made a video in a while and I keep meaning to, but, um, I'm a procrastinator, that's what I do. Um, but this is kind of a response to community channel. A couple of videos ago, the one she made about, um, irrational fears and your secret escape plan, because I've been thinking about this for a lot early, way before she made the video and I pretty much know exactly what my escape plan would be, but first let's talk about my fear. I have an irrational fear of, um, people hiding in dark spaces at night in my room. Um, which doesn't sound that irrational, but pretty much every night I do the same thing. I turn off all the lights in my room, whatever and I'm about to go to bed. Except for that -- at night I check my email. That's when I go on Youtube, watch videos whatever. So all the lights in my room are off and then I just have my computer screen going and I stare at it for a while, so everything around me is dark and then when I close my computer screen and put that away, I still can't really see very well, 'cause, um, the light has been so bright in my face so I can't see. And then I normally curl up into the fetal position and start thinking about the fact that there's got to be people in my room somewhere, hiding. They're about to attack me. Normal places are -- there's a corner over there that, um, is dark and there's my closet which is back over there, uh, which is very small and dark and scary at night and I get to thinking that there have to be people in there and I'm always in the fetal position away from my closet looking in the other corner so I can't see those two places. Um, and I just keep on telling myself, there's no one there, there can't be anyone there, I've been there the whole time. Like I know the light was on in my face and someone could have snuck in because I couldn't see around me anyways, but there's no one in there and I kind of just like put it at bay and start thinking about something else. But then a couple of minutes later, I'm freaked out again and I'm just thinking I've been lying in this one position, like, what if someone snuck in behind me and they're hiding in my closet and they're about to pop up and they're just like, um, and like, attack me. So my initial plan a long time ago, was just kind of like, if they came up from behind which was how it always in my head works, I full bang them, I like smack their face and then I scream as loud as possible because my parents are only a few rooms down. And that was the whole plan, but lately I've been thinking about it again and I have weapons now. So the new plan is to smack in the face and scream and then rather like mend in their nose or whatever I did to them because I'm super strong in this dream, yes. Can't you tell how strong I am? Um, I reach down and I pick up the knitting needle, because I always leave knitting needles near my bed now because I knit a lot. This is not just like because of this fear, I do knit a lot. But heavy nails, this is my favorite because it's metal and it's sharp and it's thin and I could just turn around and just stab somewhere, like you said, probably in the eye because that would be the most time consuming place and then, I normally keep this over my door, but I just got it so I can show you and then I got the newest part of the plan because I just got this not long ago from some of friends. We were in China Town and they bought me a samurai sword - here, I'll take off the sheath. It's like actually sharp. It's like a sharpened samurai sword so I get up while they're mending their eye which I just stabbed with a knitting needle. Ooh, there we go. Um, and I run for the sword and then I'm holding them there with the sword like, what you going to do now? I have a sword in your face. Bam. Yeah, but that's my plan. There's this sick little part of me though that really wants it to happen. Like as scary as that would be, is it weird that there's part of me in myself that's like I want to try out my plan? I want to. Um, I'll make another video soon because I have other stuff to talk about other than how I'm going to kill an assassin who's hiding in my closet. Okay. Mwah. Bye.
