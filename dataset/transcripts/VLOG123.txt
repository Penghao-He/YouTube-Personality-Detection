Hey, YouTube. It's XXXX real name no gimmicks. How's it going people? Due to the success of the XXXX review review, which I thank everybody very much for watching, I'm going to do another computer game review. And today's computer game review I'm going to do today is XXXX.
Now I've got the limited hardened edition copy. XXXX, where can I begin now really? This game has got so much hype. It had so many commercials, trailers and even a little trailer . 
The hype of this game was tremendously huge. I could not believe it, it was just so unbelievable. It's a game here, like last year that was tremendously high. It was also the very first ever video game to receive a film premier style at London's Leicester Square which was absolutely amazing with this, it just shows how far computer games have become. And also not only that, on the first day of the UK launch it sold one point twenty three million copies, it's just -- it's unbelievable, it's absolutely fantastic. I'll tell you, it makes it the biggest selling computer game on its first day ever. It's just so unbelievable. It beat of for or five double. 
OK, enough about the hype and all the trailers and all the commercials I've been sort of talking about. Now let's talk about the game. Well, in this review, I'll also be showing you game play footage of me playing the game. All right, okay, so we're gonna do a bit of a crossfire against different enemies which is really cool. 
Okay, now for the story line, the main campaign load. It takes place five years after the original Call of Duty game. The marines and the UAS fought the other day, in action that beat the ultra nationalists in Russia. Unfortunately though, their sort of little plan had backfired. It turned out that Zakhaev, who was the main big bloke of the original XXXX game, was revered as a martyr and hero. 
When it came to Makarov , a former lieutenant of Zakhaev, decides to take over all of Europe and put out so many terrorist attacks all over across Europe, including Russia. 
At the very beginning of the game, I played Private Allen just to try to get used to the swing of things of the game. No, really you start off with training and then you go off to Afghanistan and go to Siberia. And then you head into Mother Russia as a CIA operative and this is where the controversy comes in. 
Politicians and the media have gotten involved with this particular level, level three, where you work as a CIA operative, join up with Makarov and shoot enough civilians at the local Russian air --
To me, though, I found this level a little bit queasy because I found it quite in the big shock value, but I feel like the media and politicians have taken this level a little bit too far and only based it on judgment of hype about video clips of the airports that were being shown rather than playing that particular level as well. 
But one thing I do like with , just before you start the campaign mode you do get an option to actually skip that particular level or decide to play it. And then it -- once you get into that particular level and decide, oh this is a bit too queasy or a bit too harsh or a thing and that, you can actually skip that particular level. It's not with any other level as well. I like that little feature as well, it's kinda like really really cool. 
After the controversial level three, you will be playing as many other different soldiers that including Sergeant Roach who works for the task force one forty one. 
Okay, so we're now going to a mission in Brazil. 
Now enough about talking about the storyline, what about the game itself? I feel like there is a -- when I play in single player mode, it's a little bit too easy but it's kinda like really cool. The levels are really, really intense. There's loads and loads of action going on, especially from the very first level when you first start, it's absolutely fantastic. I love it, the graphics are so detailed. 
You get it in there, when you get shot, you saw I have blood going across the screen and that. It's really really quite cool. It's makes it so like really realistic as well. They put in a lot of details as well which is actually fantastic with the building size, the building. 
And it's got a lot of various different weapons, whether it's like a desert eagle, an A K forty seven, or rifle shotgun, or a sniper gun. And it's really, it's quite cool, you can pick up many, many different weapons along the way. 
To me I was thinking like, this is going to be like another first person sort of shoot out and it is sort of the way is. I mean, to me, I kinda have a dislike though for first person shooters. Some of them are really good but most of them are sorta like, Oh, they're just all the same, this sort of thing, like Far Cry Two. Like I was saying, I feel like the campaign mode doesn't add enough storyline and development sort of thing. I feel like it could be carried off a lot more better. 
There are a number of different locations you can travel across. I don't know -- there were a number of different locations with this game which makes this probably a real epic first person shoot out. Which includes from Afghanistan, Siberia, America, Brazil, and even going into a mission out into outer space in one particular point as well which I find really cool. 
I love the attention and detail, though of the Siberia level, when you're out climbing those mountains. 
I find it a bit of a struggle though, to climb those mountains at first, but after a little bit of time, I really got the hang of it which is really cool. You can drive a number of different vehicles, including the snowmobile, which I found really fun and enjoyable though on the second level. 
Now I haven't finished the campaign mode, but I have found it a little too easy though just to get sort of thing. They're very very small levels and it doesn't have too much depth to it. I think it was more focused on the graphics, though, and the voice acting. Speaking about the voice acting, I think it's absolutely superb. Yeah, news is better. 
There are two other different modes in this game. You have the special ops team where you have -- play different types of missions to gain stars sort of thing, where you need to do training, races, try to shoot people down, try to take out all kinds of guys. I think this is absolutely fantastic. 
You can play this on your own or play with a friend, though really as well. I think this is actually a really neat idea, it makes it really cool. And that's what brings in the fun sort of thing. I think this is one of those features that's a lot better though, than the main campaign mode. 
I did try to complete one of the special ops where I had to try and kill -- make thirty kills without killing more than six civilians, which I kept on failing all the time, but it's a nice little neat challenge. It makes you try and make and try and figure out which is the best option to go through to help to take out the entire gang. I think this is really good. The strategy in this game is absolutely brilliant. The AI is really really good. 
And the main reason that people have bought XXXX, yeah that's right, it's the multi player. With these death matches, it's like eight players, for everybody going at each other. It's really -- kinda like really fancy stuff. I've played it a couple of times, it is really good. The multiplayer is absolutely phenomenal. The nine on nine mode is actually is true, you can do it in teams. And there's also, yeah, you can have the individual free form, where you're -- it's for every man to themself. That's what I've been mainly been playing. I've really had a real kick out of it as well. 
I have had so much fun over it and I will be keep on playing the multiplayer as well. When you pick up points for the multiplayer, you can pick up new weapons, new perks, new equipment, which eventually in the near future, you'll be able to drop bombs over the enemies as well. I've had a few bombs dropped on me as well, and it's not a pleasant sight. 
I've been in the multiplayer mode with somebody; you can play on for hours and hours and hours. And the same there with the special ops, just to make yourself real -- really better though, really. I bet those are the two best modes, though, of the entire game. 
Okay, what about the negatives? I feel like the campaign mode's storyline isn't really juicy, isn't really sorta like really strong, as I thought it would be, but they do have a couple of twists and turns as well within the story. I'm hoping to really look forward to find out what these are. 
The pricing for the game, including this, I paid like seventy pounds, I think is a bit too much though really, but it does come with a nice couple of little goodies. Again, the price, again is a bit of a problem, like forty five pounds just for the game by itself, but I bet you they just want to be different from the rest of the market but other than that I've been seeing it's a bit pricey but it's still worth the money. 
So if you do want to buy XXXX, I think that you may want to play with a friend or play with a lot of people online though. It's just a really really good game on those special types of things. 
Okay, so I'm going give you like two different slightly ratings here. For the campaign single player mode, I'd probably give maybe three and a half. With the multiplayer with special ops I'm going to give four and three quarters. Yeah, I bet this is more of a game though that you want to play with your friends online. 
Overall, I give this game probably four and a quarter. Now I know some of you are going to think yeah, that's a bit of a controversial market -- thinking oh Barry, you should rate it five out of five. I don't know, I feel the campaign mode is a huge letdown. 
Okay, guys my next review is going to be the new XXXX and I hope you take care and I hoped you enjoyed my review of XXXX. 
Peace out.
