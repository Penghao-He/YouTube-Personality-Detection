Hey YouTube. Before I started, I just wanted to say thank you for continuing to watch my videos and for subscribing and everything like that. I just logged on today and I just saw the amount of subscribers I had. In the big picture, it's not that much, but I mean, it's just so cool that you guys are actually interested. 
I know there's so many like, funny, stupid, brainless sort of videos on the internet. You click on them and you watch them. And that's cool, I'm guilty of it too. Failblog all the way. But you know, I wanna try and do something different with this channel. You know, I want to sorta encourage like, thinking and shared creativity and inspire and just make people think, you know. 
And I know a lot of people aren't really up for that and I know, the internet, it's a great way to do that. But the quantity of those kinds of videos and the popularity of those obviously aren't as big of some of the other more comedic, uh, stupid videos out there. You know, so to see that many people interested in my videos is really amazing, so thank you so much for that. Really. 
All right, sorry for that bit of a tangent there. Man, man, I just sorta wanted to talk -- I haven't actually done one of these in a long time. I've just been so busy, it feels kinda strange to talk to my computer again. 
I just want to talk a bit about like, dreams and goals. You know, we all have 'em. We all want to do things in our life and get certain places in our life and accomplish certain things. I -- I mean, I have a lot of goals. I have a lot of big dreams, but sometimes it just gets to a point where, you know, it scares me almost every single day, to think that I might not achieve them. You know, might not get to where I want to be or, you know, things just won't work out the way I hope they -- hope they -- hope they woo -- clearly I haven't done this in a long time. Hope they do, so it's good to be determined. 
I am definitely very determined and I have a lot of things on my to do list. I am going to do that. I'm determined to follow through on these ambitions and you know, do what I want to do in my life and be happy and content. And that determination, you know, comforts me. 
But at the same time, I'm getting to a point where, it's, you know if I, if I don't quite get to where I want to be, how I feel that I won't be fulfilled. You know, that I won't be satisfied. 
And it's scary. It's like someone wanting to dig a hole to Japan, you know, the old myth that you could just dig a hole through the earth to get to the other side, China or Japan. And I'm digging that hole and I'm going down there and I'm getting there, but at the same time I look back and I'm so deep that there's no way out of it, you know. I'm on this route and I have these dreams and I have to get there. But at the same time, it's scary because I know that if I don't get there, I'm going to be stuck in this hole. 
It's -- I don't know, basically I'm rambling, gosh. I just was wondering. You know? I'm sure many of you have dreams and ambitions or had some and you've achieved them, maybe accomplished them, maybe are still working on them. What do you do to sort of comfort yourself in hopes of achieving them, you know? How do you, you know, tell yourself that you know, everything's going to be okay; things will work out the way they're supposed to work out? 
Because to me, just saying that is not enough. You know, I have these dreams. I want to do some big things in my life. You know, I want to get into film and I want to, you know, I wanna make movies; I want to write movies; I want to act in movies. I want to do all those things. Fine, that's a hard thing to do. There's hundreds of other damn Goldbergs out here wanting to do the same thing and why me? 
So basically, I'm just asking what do you guys do to sort of help your own selves out, you know? What do you -- what do you do to help bring up that confidence or maintain your calmness, I guess? Sometimes I'm sitting at home, feeling like I should be doing something, working on my dreams, you know. Like doing something that will get me further. 
Cause sometimes I just can't. You know, I'm sitting at home, at work in a few hours and there's really nothing else to do except watch some TV. But to me it's like wasted time, like I should constantly be doing something to help me get to where I want to be in my life and you know, in one way I guess it's a good thing. You know, I have this determination, but at the same time it freaks me out every day, you know. Scares me every day to think that I have all these dreams and that potentially they might not turn out the way I want them to. 
I don't know. I -- basically I just -- what are your thoughts on that and like I said, what do you guys and girls do to, you know, just make it all better and, you know, bring out that confidence in yourselves to actually achieve these? 
Wow, I'm really rambling. This one is going to have to be edited down a lot. Yeah, so anyways, it's really hot up here so I think I'm going to go downstairs and get a really cold drink, so yeah. Anyways, talk to you later, bye.
