Hello. So I just got home for Easter break and what did I find but I -- I turned around the other way but it had my address on it and I saw some present, I could really show you. But I got a package with my name on it and I'm pretty sure it's my giraffe shirt from, um, XXXX so I'm really excited and I thought I'd make a video and show you guys. My gosh. I can't wait. Oh no. Okay, um, it's -- it'a not a giraffe shirt I guess, but, oh man that's oh -- that's oh -- that's so cool. Okay, so I was really excited to get my giraffe shirt, um, however, um, I ended up -- I ended up getting my red shirt instead. Look. That's partly red. I'm so excited, I truly forgot this was even coming in the mail. Well it's a t shirt. I didn't -- I didn't get what I thought I was going to get, but I got a party red shirt. I also got a little red key chain, a slinky note, a light sporty yo yo and um, and a little message that says "Hi XXXX. Write good days as provided, best wishes, XXXX. Yeah, that's kinda like anti climatic. I really wanted my giraffe shirt. Not that I don't love this red shirt. It's just really -- really hoping for the giraffe shirt and I got my hopes up. I'll make another video of my giraffe shirt sometime. Bye
 I just broke it. Some of you are wondering, XXXX doesn't play with yo yo's, she breaks them. Oh no. I wonder if I can fix this. Oh, you know if anyone wants to fix my yo yo, um, I would appreciate it. I'm sorry red. I'm sorry I failed at my -- this is why you shouldn't do me favors. Just so you know my, um, yo yo hit these little guys and they're made of glass and I'm really surprised it didn't ---
