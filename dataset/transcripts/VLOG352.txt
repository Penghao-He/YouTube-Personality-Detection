Hi, guys. Er, XXXX here. Er, just a quick announcement to make. XXXX, er, we are making a music video, and the video will, of course, contain a song. 
The song is going to be based on bikes, bloggers, what we do, who we are, and why we're here and also based around the forums and our viewers. The song will be in regular format, such as intro, verse, chorus, verse, break, chorus, outro . 
So, regular song style; around three minute mark, maybe a bit bigger, maybe a bit shorter, that's up to you. And the reason it's up to you is, here's the catch, we need your help. 
If you're watching this video and you have a basic knowledge of making music, we need you to produce a track. That means in the basic format, so that we can have intro, verse, chorus, verse, break, chorus, outro. 
We might change the style up a little bit, but the same principle. I'll produce the final em, track, with the vocals, et cetera, and it's up to you to produce the actual music we use. 
We might not necessarily use your track, if you post it, but it will be very helpful and we would appreciate your efforts in joining in with the community. This is a community effort and hopefully it will work out well. 
The song will be actually titled XXXX. That best describes what the song is about, motovlos, and of course, it all takes on XXXX. 
If you click the link in the description, whatever side that's on, or down there if you're watching in widescreen, or if you're watching in full screen, get out of full screen and then look at the description box. There will be a link to the forum topic, explaining. So, if you go there, read it, make a beat, upload it with mp three format, we'll listen to it, if it's good, um, or we're going to use it we'll message you and let you know. 
We'll also be taking, um, people's videos to use in the actual final music video. The video will be available on my channel, on XXXX, probably, on other bloggers' channels maybe, and it will be available as a three, as a three? As a free mp three download. 
Er, support the community and get active. This should be fun. 
Click the link, guys.
