That was three of my top brackets. These actually haven't, all -- of all three of them. And I would like to know what your brackets are and you can either make a video response or if you've got any comments. Video response would be much better for this because I think it requires a degree of emotion, and of course presentation. 
If you'd like to just explain it or make an actual video like I did, a full video with an action, then that would be cool as well. 
I'll watch them all, I'll try to read all the comments. 
Thanks for watching this, I really appreciate it. 
I can't wait to hear from everyone who participates, so goodbye and I hope you enjoyed this video. 
﻿Hello. So I was just um, sitting down laying around, eh, when I thought of a concept. Recently I had read a novel, The Last King of Scotland, and em, I spent quite a lot of time reading the text and I noticed one thing about the book -- there was a lot of em, use of brackets, or if you're American -- parentheses, I believe it's called. Basically, you em -- you read the book and you get the dialogue and the writer. But sometimes in the book the writer likes to -- the character who the writer is, em -- has wrote about likes to elaborate on -- on a subject or likes to give their real opinion, as opposed to what they said in the book. So you might have like -- something like -- oh yeah, sure I'll do this, and then in brackets it'll say, like, I did not want to do this -- something like that. Or it -- it'll provide more detail. 
Now I was thinking about if there were brackets in real life, like say you were asked a question and you reply to this question. What you say may not -- may or may not be honest. It may be, em, a lie, white or otherwise. Maybe the true feelings it may not have been expressed in the response. I'd just like to share with everybody here a few of my brackets -- or what my brackets would be if we were able to see what people thought, or -- or if you were able to elaborate on something you'd already said. I'll just, em, show you now. 
So, Michael. I want you to clean this entire floor as quickly as possible. If you don't get it cleaned enough, em, I'm gonna make you stay until four thirty. 
I'll get right on it. 
I had a really great day, Michael. 
Me, too.
