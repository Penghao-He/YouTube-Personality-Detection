Okay, take two. Um, did you ever have one of those days where you just felt like an alien from another planet? I mean, everywhere you go, it's like weird? 
Like you go in the grocery store and you're like, you know, somebody says um, did you find everything you need and I'm like, well um, I could use a million dollars. And it's like it's just, hm, like they don't even respond. I mean, that's kinda lame but, you know, they could say something. 
I mean, every person I encountered today was just so not funny, at all. It was bizarre. I was like, I don't know, it's the kinda day that you -- you walk away and like not one single person smiles at you or laughs at anything you say and they just look at you like you're crazy and you go home and you like, start thinking that you're a loser, because like, you talk too much and you say stupid stuff and like you just open your mouth to change feet and you just feel like a total loser because you're not funny. You're not funny at all. And you're so not funny that you begin to really like, freak out and think, what's wrong with me? 
And then like you get on your iPod and you start listening to all this depressing music and like, you're so into that like depressing mood, you know? 
It's like Emo and you're listening to this stuff and you're just like oh my God, I'm such a loser. I am such a loser. I want to jump off a cliff. 
And then like, all of a sudden your iPod shuffles and it's like, Amazing Grace or something that you put on there like ten years ago when you like, never had an iPod before. But -- I mean it's like all a sudden then you're like, oh Jesus I love you, thank you so much for I'm so glad I'm alive. 
And then all of a sudden like that other stuff starts splaying again, and then all of a sudden you're like, jamming to Boston and it's like, you're thinking about the old days and then you start to think, oh my God, I'm old. I remember when Boston, More Than a Feeling came out. 
And then like, that makes you feel worse because not only now are you not funny and you talk too much, now you're old too. 
Wow, okay, that's like so depressing.
