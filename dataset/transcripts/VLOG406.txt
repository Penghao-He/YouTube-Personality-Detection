So, um, this is my cat Tara and, um, you can say hi to Miley, Tera. Say hi to Miley, yeah, say hi, say hi. Okay, well she doesn't want to say hi. But, um, I'll say hi for you, hi Miley, hello? There you go, you go a "hi" out of her. Also the dog happens to be here, yeah, you see, his name is Erk . Erk, Erk, say hi. Oop, he doesn't want to say hi. Um, which is weird because he's a dog. Do you know who Miley is? Do you know who Miley is? Not Miley Cyrus, Miley the dog. Naw, not, still thinking it's Miley Cyrus, doesn't want to talk to her. That's what they have, that's about it, those were the two dogs. Oo, Sushi can say hi to you. Sushi, Sushi, say hi to Miley. Hi Miley, hi Miliey. Yeah, I have a fish named Sushi, figure that one out.
