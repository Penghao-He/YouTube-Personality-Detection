Hey guys. I know it's been a while. I've started uni and everything and a lot of stuff has been happening. I've been moving back to my house and everything; that's why I haven't made any videos and, yeah. I thought I'd do some videos today, as seeing I have time and everything, I'm off uni for a day and, um. 
Yeah, so I thought I'd do my September favorites, as you can probably tell from the title. 
Well before I start, I dyed my hair and got it cut. Um, I got it darker. It used to be really light, like reddish blond. Now it's more of a chocolaty blond, like a darker one if you can tell. It's completely different. Um, I'll do a before and after picture of what it was like and I'll probably be in my blog and I'll put the link in the side bar and yeah, so. The before picture's gonna be a picture from E, so if you want to see that as well, you guys can and yeah. So I thought I'd do my September favorites. 
And the first thing I want to pick are my two favorite brushes of the month, which were my all time favorite brushes. This one was like my -- before I started buying my own makeup, I started using this brush a lot. It was like, my only brush, which is the Cosmopolitan and blusher brush star 'cause I normally used sponges for my foundation and the sponges that you get with the eye shadows and that was like the only things I used to use and that was my only brush at that time. 
And, yeah, I really like this brush, because it's really affordable and it's like, five pounds or something in Superdrug and it's really soft for a drugstore brush. I haven't bought any like, any other drugstore brushes like, as far as I know, and I happen to be in Milly and number seven, I think, I'm not too sure, but this is a really good quality brush and it's really soft. 
And this brush here, the foundation brush, I use this as a 109 brush like the way I would use a one o nine brush, because it's very good at stippling in the foundation, blending it in. I really like this brush and it's not round, um, it's like tapered there and the reason why I like that is because if you want to do, um, your foundation like this, you can. You can use it all different ways and sometimes I use it for cream blush, to do it like that, do, um, a straight line lash and contouring as well, even though it's, um, like synthetic fibers, I still use it for contouring. So there are my two brushes. There. 
I have two mascaras from my favorite. First one is it's probably been in my favorites for the last couple of times and the reason why I just love this one is because of the, um, the brush, um, the formulation. And I use this only for my lower lash; I don't use it for my top lash. I love it for my lower lash and I'm wearing it today, if you can see. I'm using that today and I absolutely love this and mascara for that purpose and I don't use it for my top lash. The only reason because it gives you length, which I don't really look for in a mascara. I look for volume and thickness, so that's why I use this for my bottom lashes. 
And the second mascara is the Bourjois Coup de Theatre -- Coup de Theatre, two in one. Um, again, the formulation of, um, this mascara is brilliant. I love the brush, it's the plastic combed brushes there. And I just spent my because I think it's much easier to use as a -- um, to use -- it makes it easier because if you can see, it just gets in more better than a strip brush and the formulation is really good. It makes my lashes look thicker and it gives that wee bit of volume. I really find a good mascara that gives me the color, but it gives me volume and thickness, which is really good. 
And another thing is the matte luster drops. The reason why I love this it gives you that really nice bronzy glowy look which I love. I always mix it in with my foundation. Haven't really used it as a highlight, but for a foundation it's brilliant. It gives you this really nice shiny glowy effect if you're looking for that, that dewy look, which is supposed to be really in for Autumn as well, which is really good and, yeah, I really love it. And the one I have it in is in sunrush. I wish I got more of these actually because I only got one of them. Now I want more of them, so, yeah, really like that. 
Another Mark Daniel is my mineralized eye shadow, which is from their permanent line, I think it's the jewels and the one I like is play on plums which is this gorgeous plumy color at the top and this orange plumy color at the bottom, because it has that plum color at the end of the bottom, like all over here, and I'll do you a quick swatch. And there's the darker color here and the lighter color there. That's what I'm using on my eyes today if you're wondering. 
And, yeah, I used to put a black in the outer corners just to smoke it out a wee bit, but I really love it. It's great when you use it with fixed glass of water, but if you use it dry, you'll find a lot of fall out there's less fall out and the sha -- eye shadow's more intense. 
Um, yeah, nail polish of the month has to be my -- my -- um -- bright purple, which I've been using a lot this month. I'm not using it today, but I love it. It's just a gorgeous black purple color; it's great for summer -- it was great for the summer and now it's great for, um, the autumn as well. This purple is really in. 
And two lip products. First one is my Maybelline. Um, I don't know what type of lipstick. It's a Maybelline lipstick, I know that and the color is and it's this gorgeous brown, medium brown color. There; which is really lovely and for a nude color and there's this swatch; it's really moisturizer and it doesn't really dry my lips or anything. And the only downside is doesn't last long, but most of my lipsticks don't last long, but it's really moisturizing and I'd really recommend this lipstick. 
And second lipstick is from the number seventeen range from in the UK and this is one is the lasting fix lipstick in Hawaii pink. This is a really nice bright bubble gum pur -- pink color -- color and that's really nice to go with nude lips. Does it match my nail polish? It kind of matches my nail polish. I'm wearing pink flamingo if you're wondering and yeah, this is a really nice lipstick. It's not as moisturizing as the Maybelline one, but it's a great color payoff. There, if you can see, that's it there; it's a gorgeous color. 
Yeah, so, and last but not least my favorite eye liner of the month is My Gosh eyeliner in black ink. It's really creamy and it's not that hard. Like I heard most of My Gosh eyeliners have been disappointing for some people, because it's been hard and everything. Um, I have this and I have alligator which is the green one and both of them have worked perfectly fine for me and they're really nice and creamy and they haven't dried me out or anything, so, and they stay on my eyes for a long time because I think they're waterproof. Yeah, they're waterproof which is really good as well. 
So, um, that's my favorite, guys and I hope you enjoyed. If you have any, um, questions or queries just leave a comment down below and comment me and subscribe.
