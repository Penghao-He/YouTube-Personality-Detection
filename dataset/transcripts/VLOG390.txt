Hey, super short video, um, so last night, um, my brother kidnapped me, and we went to, um, the town I used to live in where he lives now, and um, we kind of sort of partied but it was kind of lame, 'cause there was drama, and there was a lot of drama and, like, a couple of people got way, way, freaking drunk, and I ended up being the babysitter with uh, my friend, Brani, who doesn't drink, and we ended up freaking taking care of this fucking psychotic girl who just really seriously is a crazy lightweight. Like, I've taken hydromorphone earlier in the day, that's, um, Dilaudid, it's, um, an opiate for migraines. Well, it's not specifically for migraines; my doctor gave it to me for migraines and I, um, I took two earlier in the day and um, I don't know, it was, um, I don't know a total of like four or five milligrams of hydromorphone and that's pretty serious stuff and uh, granted, uh, I had like in six hours -- fourteen, to wear down, but still --
Um, yeah, so I was drinking, and uh, I had quite a bit, for someone who's on opiates and she was wasted, like, a really, really long time, before I was. And I was like, that's ridiculous; you are a crazy lightweight. And that's pathetic and you know, you're annoying, and you're hitting on me and I don't like girls. And like, oh, it was just so, so horrible. And I'm so, like you know, I just want to hang out with my brother before he goes to Iraq and you are totally just ruining the night. So I'm going to go back over there before he leaves next week on Thursday. So what was I saying; I'm gonna go back there and chill, without alcohol, because I just want to have a nice, you know, few hours hanging out with my baby brother because he's leaving for Iraq and I won't be seeing him for like a year or so. So um, yeah, hopefully she won't be there and she's off puncturing her face. Um, but yeah, that's what went down yesterday and I'm about out of time. So yeah, um, there's your update.
