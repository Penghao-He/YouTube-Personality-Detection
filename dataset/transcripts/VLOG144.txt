One last thing whoever sent me this, yes, I would very much like my legs back. I don't know how you got them, but I haven't been able to move from this seat for three days and my butt is starting to get very, very chapped. 
So, send those back at any time. I would really appreciate it, so that I can get up and eat, which is my favorite thing to do. 
PS -- that means post script by the way, did you know that? Congratulations to Château of a Doubt for reaching fifty subscribers. 
Much love from me to you. This is getting creepy. I'll stop now. I'm just going to go. 
﻿Okay, XXXX, let's see how many women you can take off today, yeah. That's my life goal right there. To be a woman, you have to be caring and loving and a little unforgiving. Please don't hurt me. 
Think that men are pigs, because if you don't, then you will be seen as a traitor to your own gender, apparently. I'm pretty sure someone is going to shank me down in the night for saying that. If you're a person of my age, then when you were little you have to have gone to a slumber party where you dressed up as one of the Spice Girls. I know all of you have done that, don't even lie to me. You have to have gone through a phase when you were little that you just thought makeup was the greatest thing ever invented and that you needed it. Love chocolate, it is your best friend. It will heal the sick and cure blindness. Be self critical. No matter how good you look, always turn to someone and ask, does this make me look fat? 
Okay, now I feel that I have ticked enough of you that I can turn Twitter and avoid being shanked down in the middle of the night. So, here are what the people on Twitter have to say about being a girl. Beef Muffin Hippo says that you have to look at yourself in every reflective surface you see, because, I don't know, you think you have cheeseburger stuck on your face. 
Ellie says that you have to be interested in makeup, be a good cook, and please remember I am not saying this next part, but you can't drive. You're not good at driving. 
According to Teen Lee, you can never go anywhere alone, even the bathroom, which is disgusting and disturbed and I kinda don't want to hang out with any women, ever again. 
And Justo says you have to have celebrity crushes. 
And according to Kate, those would probably the Jonas Brothers, or Twilight characters, or someone from HSM which I'm guessing is High School Musical because I am the bomb at guessing acronyms. 
Emily says that you have to think that everyone is prettier and better dressed than you, and feel self conscious. 
Michelle says you're good at makeup, you're good a fashion, you have a lot of drama and emotion, you like to shop, and you like men. I'm a man. Do you like me? You probably don't like me, I'm sorry. 
publishing tie, yeah. 
On the last video, I made a giant mistake that I'm going to apologize for. I asked something that you couldn't stand about the opposite gender. Big mistake on my part. Sorry about all the comments. 
So instead, on this one I'm going to ask for an acronym for Obama. And no, nothing political. Obama just popped into my head for some reason. Old beavers always mall actors. Because they don't like actors, apparently. 
Despite how some of the comments were utterly sexist, I am going to show some comments that I found hilarious. Please do not shank me in my sleep for showing them. 
I thank you.
