I feel like it's been forever! I've been really busy since -- actually I don't really know when. Busy -- actually -- okay, I'm not busy -- I -- I just -- I don't know, like, every time it gets to be, like, winter and stuff, like, I go insane, like, I just -- I, um. Oh yeah, so the Halloween party that I went to was really fun the guys planned this haunted house scavenger hunting for the girls. Yeah, it was quite an experience I would say. But we didn't, like, carve pumpkins or anything. We were supposed to but what happened was the night before Halloween we went to the grocery store to buy stuff and then we couldn't find any more that sold pumpkins after, like, one o'clock in the morning so we decided to, um -- I know this is bad. I don't know if I, like, I'm gonna get in trouble for, like, saying this but we went driving through the neighborhood and we actually borrowed, um, people's pumpkins. So by the end of the night we got, like, fifty pumpkins and, um, to people who live around my neighborhood, I'm sorry. I mean if you're gonna freaking, like, put pumpkins on your front porch then who -- like, who's not gonna steal them -- you know? Like, so I'll post the pictures, um -- I mean it's not that you wanna see them anyway but I really don't care what you guys think. I'm kidding. 
 I think my hair's growing. I hate having short hair like this. It's so annoying, like, yeah, it's fun for, like, the first month but after that, like, the whole growing process is just boring. But then, I mean, if you think about it, when anything grows it's pretty sucking annoying. Me growing as a person is freaking annoying so -- I mean, duh. Wow! I'm, like, out of it. I don't know. Why am I making this video? Oh my god. 
Mmmm. We have a new President of the United States. Huh! Barack Obama! Yeah! I'm so happy -- you don't understand, like. Like, I was watching his, um, speech on YouTube, like, in Chicago and I started crying, like, I have hope in this country, I really do. I don't know if you notice but I don't have bed sheets on my bed at the moment and the reason being is because my dog decided to take a piss on my bed sheets. She never did it like until recently so, I mean, if you guys know anything about dogs can you, like, please tell me 'cause it's freaking annoying, like, I wake up and like, in the middle of the bed, and it's like, freaking A. Yeah, I'm just gonna go now. I'm not gonna say anything else.
