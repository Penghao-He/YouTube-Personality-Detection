Since our internet connection has once more decided to suck again today, I thought I could just make a video instead of watching them. 
Okay, the best thing that happened was that somebody I know or knew found my YouTube channel. That has happened before, and well, that's okay, he wrote me a nice message and yeah. The thing is that I last saw him, about, almost ten years ago. And he wrote me a message and said that he didn't recognize me at first because I looked different. 
Well, okay, it's been ten years. You never really notice that you change, yourself. The same week, I found this channel, Project Class Reunion, by Sarah Olzaga and she is planning to lose a certain amount of weight for her ten year class reunion. So, I'd also have my ten year class reunion this year. I don't know if there's going to be anything and I don't know if I can attend because I don't live that close to my parents anymore, but it got me thinking, because ten years is a long time and people change. 
And the question is when you just meet like, about thirty or forty people, what's the important thing? Is it what you achieved or what you are now? Like, what am I? I live in Berlin. I am an architect. I work in a somewhat fancy architectural office. I don't have children. I'm not married, but I live with my boyfriend for a few years. Would that be my profile? Would that be me, and how much would it say about me? Or tell about the person I am? 
So, yeah, that, that just got me thinking, who am I if I just meet someone I haven't seen for ten years. It's just like, what are you doing? Who are you now? Just, could you answer that and would it just tell anything about the person you are; not only facts, like job, kids, married stuff? 
Oh, another short thing, there's going to be this YouTube secret talent award show in ten days and that's going to be great, because it's here in Berlin and there are several people, YouTubers, coming here and I'm really looking forward to that, because it's kind of cool. I hope so. And yeah, the watcho , I don't know what to expect about that, it's just -- the interesting thing is just to meet people and have fun together and yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. So I'll see you or you'll see me in person or video or something. Bye.
