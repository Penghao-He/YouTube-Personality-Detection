Do it. 
Ariel , I have a . I got new shoes. Do you want to see them? They're pretty cool. I got them from my stepmom and think that they're pretty awesome. 
Kevin Leek , you sent me a letter and you drew me pictures and you sent me postcards but I don't know where the postcards -- postcards are right now because somebody cleaned my room and -- yeah -- and so he drew me this. It says, Kate -- and then, and, like, all little things for Kate, and then he wrote me a letter. 
We looked through how he was doing and it's really hard to describe. 
Do you put if you want me to send you a letter? I for sure will send you a letter. Just send me a message or whatever. We're kind of friendsish even if we're not friends. I mean, it would help if I -- it would help if I would have at least talked to you before, but I'll send you a letter. You guys mail them back, though. Now I'll make your fresh and everything. How exciting. I don't care who you are. I don't have any subscribers. 
Don't do that. Okay. I don't know how I'm supposed to make a cake and frost a cake. 
Well I'm gonna let you guys go so I can eat my cake. It's so good. Okay. 
I'm gonna post a video for up my question and answer video plus the answers sometime this week. So look out for that, fellows. 
Okay, bye guys, I love you but I love this cake more. Gnaw gnaw gnaw gnaw.
