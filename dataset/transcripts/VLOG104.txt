What's the one thing you can't go a day without? Okay, you have food and water and breathing. So, those are a given. Ron, you know what I'm talking about. Right. 
Ninety eight percent of you -- I'm really just making that statistic up, but I'm venturing a guess that it's pretty close to being right -- ninety eight percent of you can't go a day without listening to music, and most of that music that you listen to wouldn't be there if there wasn't someone to teach it. 
That's why this year, for the project for Austin , I'm going to talk to you guys about VH1 Save the Music program. Music programs are something that are really close to my heart, and it's something that I spend a lot of time with. I was in concert bands for seven years throughout um, junior high and high school, marching band all four years of high school, color guard and winter guard all throughout high school, and I've danced basically since I could walk, so for the last seventeen years. 
Every single one of those activities involved some kind of music, whether it's playing it, learning new music, learning a new instrument, listening to it, choreographing routines to it, whatever, it invov -- it involves some kind of music, and that music wouldn't be there if there wasn't a program for someone to teach. 
When I graduated from high school in two thousand and six, our band program consisted of almost two hundred fifty members, and our choir program was equal in size. high school now has two high schools, and the music programs at both high schools consist of about one hundred students each. 
It's not so much the interest in the programs are dropping; it's the fact that there aren't funds to make these programs possible any more. The VH One Save the Music Foundation provides grants of new musical instruments to public, elementary and middle schools that don't currently have any instrumental music program in place. Most of these schools don't have a program already in place because there's just not the funds to teach it. The school district doesn't have the funds to buy the instruments or to hire the directors or to buy music. 
It may not seem like it, but if you walk into any high school band room, the equipment and the instruments that are in that room are probably equal to a value of the school itself. Even if your school district doesn't qualify for a grant from the Save the Music Foundation, there are a ton of things you can do to keep programs running. The next time your local band or choir comes knocking on your door for a can or bottle drive, see what you have. Give it to them. Chances are you're just going to throw it out anyways. 
Okay, so it is the middle of December, and it's not really football season any more, but next fall, any Friday night football game, take a second. Watch the band perform at halftime. Even just watching shows support. 
Does your town have some kind of local fall festival? Winter festival? Anything like that? Chances are there is a band or choir performing at it. Check 'em out. See what they have to offer. Most music programs put on about five or six concerts a year in addition to performing at football games, parades, graduation ceremonies, and things like that. 
Even if you can't afford to help out the programs financially, just by showing up is some kind of support. A lot of programs will do a bottle drive or a canned food drive at the concert itself in the place of an admission fee. It's a great way to donate and a great way to stay involved with whatever is going on. 
So next time you're dancing around your room to your favorite song on the radio -- and you know which one I'm talking about take a second and think about how your life would be if you didn't have that music, if there hadn't been anyone to teach that music. 
I'm going to post a link in the sidebar to the VH One Save the Music program website and also to another great video at one of my uh, favorite bands put out this morning, the Oceanic Six. They also did the Save the Music program, and you can check out their latest single, which is at the end of their video as well. 
And I'm going to try to post this as a video response to that and see what happens. 
So, links in the sidebar. Go check it out. Support your local music program; it's a great thing.
