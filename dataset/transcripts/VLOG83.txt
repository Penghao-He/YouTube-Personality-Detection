Hey everybody, it is the twentieth of April. I just wanted to post a quick video, a very quick video. I want to open up the forum and, for the first time, I'm inviting people to ask any questions they may have, you know, maybe I can do a question and answer thing. Anything you want to know about me, anything you want to know about my views on the show, maybe you want a good recipe for chili, anything. You know, just I'm opening up the floor to people like you to interact. 
You can ask your questions in the comments or over in the sidebar. There's going to be a link to my twitter and to my email. So you can, you know, reach me there, ask any question you want, and I'll try to answer them as best I can in the next video. Maybe I'll do this every week if it catches on. Um, there you go, guys. Enjoy the rest of the week, bye.
