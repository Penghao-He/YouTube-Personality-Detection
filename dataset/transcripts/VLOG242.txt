Hey guys, you knew this rant was coming. My rant about women, women in general. Now let me start off with women are very judgmental. Oh no, no I'm not, no I always care about the person's personality. To and extent, you guys don't give a fuck about the personality of a man. Okay, you can walk into a room, three guys sitting there and you know all of them. First one kind of looks like Robert Pattinson a little bit and he's kind of a jerk. Middle one kind of and average Joe not the best looking, but he's there but he doesn't have the personality of being your boyfriend. Third one, kind like a little bit over weight, ugly but really funny, really nice personality and cares about people. Who are you going to go for? You're going to go for the Robert Pattinson guy because he's the guy that you can take back to your friends and gloat, look at my hot ass boyfriend. Yet he's probably going to cheat on you because that's what hot, jerk, assholes do. They are, like, I have one girl, let's see if I can get two. Even four who the fuck knows? So then you're left traumatized for having your heart broken by this guy to not wanting to date any other guy for the rest of your life. Now guys like me, we know that we are not going to be the first choice -- first pick of any girl but we know that later in life that the stupid girls from high school are going to come flying back to us because girls are really fucking stupid in high school when it comes to guys anyway. They go for the hot guy, the guy that will cheat on her, the guy that will break her heart. Later in life she'll realize, oh, we wanted one of the average Joe or the not so good looking guy because they're the people that are going to care -- those're the people who're going to care for your family. They're the ones that you want to live with. They're the ones that you actually want to have a life with. But you're not going to realize this 'til your about in your thirties so ladies I'd give you advice now. Uh, don't always go for the hottest piece of ass guy that you can -- that you can find. Because most likely, they won't treat you as most other ones will. Okay, girls are always like I want to go for the football player, I want to go for the basketball player, I want to go for somebody who has a good job because you're always money hungry and you're always power hungry. If you can get yourself famous or something, he'll go for it. But there are some girls out there who think, hey I care about the personality, I don't care about looks. Well, you do. Yeah, you go to the mall and your always going to be, like, look at that cute guy over there. You may not fall in love with him, but if he greets you in a nice manner and he seams like a nice guy your head over heals in love with him already. That's how guys have the greatest power over women. They use their looks and their quick charm to try to take over a girl's life. Well her heart, not necessarily her life. It's to their advantage and keep them on a leash for a long time and it's not a good sign. And it makes the rest of us look really bad. It makes all of us look like we're a bunch of jerks. Like, girls have always said, I hate all men; all men are assholes, all men will cheat on you, well no, they won't. A good -- a good amount probably will. A large amount of men will think with their dick head and not their really head first which is not all of us. You have to remember that, that not all guy are bad guys -- just those ones that use their power and their looks to their advantage. I know some guys who found out, hey, I'm good looking and they use it to their advantage in the wrong ways. They break girls' hearts left and right, cheat on them and then convince them to come back with them which is not cool one bit, if you want to, you don't deserve the one your given. That one should stay in your heart alone. Now I may come out as kind of a douche bag or something in this video, but I'm not trying to. I'm trying to convince somewhat of high school type women to realize that, hey, it's not always the smartest to go after the hottest guy or the guy who will give you popularity. Go for the ones that you truly feel in your heart are the better people, not always go for the best ones. And also stop leading the other ones on. While you're waiting for you sweat heart to fall to his knees, you have to find a friend too. You find that -- you take that ugly guy. You take the one who has a good personality who will help you move up the ladder. The one who will make you feel good about yourself so much to the point that you will have enough confidence to go for that top guy. But it will make the guy on the bottom feel like you care about him. Feel that he has a chance. When really he doesn't have a chance in the world. You're just using him which is not cool. I know not all ladies do this, but I know quite the few that have. Now I'm not trying to say that all girls are bitches. I'm not trying to say -- I'm not trying to blame it on anything. A lot of guys use their looks to their advantage. A lot of girls play with their looks and their charm on guys who move up levels and that's not right and I hope some day you can realize that and maybe even notice some of these people around your school. People who have used this against their advantage and try to help other friends stay away from these problems. If you see a friend going for some guy who is known for cheating, keep the girl away from him. And girls just leading guys', on it's not fun and of course you crush your guys heart into a powdery substance shit. Now this was more of a serious rant than a comedic rant. Sorry. I really need to get some of this shit out I hope you still comment, rate, subscribe, um, make a response. I would love a response. It would be sweet if you could make a video response to this. And uh, this is -- this is XXXX and hopefully I don't have to make another serious pissed off rant again.
