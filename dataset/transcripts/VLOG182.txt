Hey, YouTube. It's XXXX, and uh, before I get going on what I actually want to talk about, there is one thing I do want to talk about before that, and that is my return to YouTube. I am coming back. I am going to post as many views as I can. I have a couple of videos ready to be uploaded, and then yede, yede, blah, blah, blah. Um, yeah, so I need to do that and I will do it uh, this weekend, hopefully, and post those next week during my spring break, but that is not what I wanted to talk about. 
Now it isn't a matter of fact I am doing word accents, or about the fact that I am adjusting my laptop. Or about the fact that I moving, so I can grab what I wanted to talk about. What I wanted to talk about is this Pocky, but not the strawberry flavored Pocky, because I really don't like the strawberry flavored, uh. So um, big thanks to Kevin for, eh, running this part of my video, because, eh, I want to use the original flavor of Pocky for this, but all I have left is my strawberry because he stole the last three pieces of it today, so thanks. I hate you. And I really dislike the strawberry flavor. So, yeah. I am just gonna sit here and eat my crappy strawberry flavored Pocky. Wish I had some original flavored. Make me so mad sometimes. 
Uh, I been -- now that I am done sulking. Uh, so Pocky, if you don't know is -- it's kind of like a cookie in a way. It's kind of like -- yeah, it's like this. This is a strawberry flavored Pocky stick. Uh, they come in packages like this. You can actually buy them at, like, super Walmarts. I didn't know this until, like, yesterday. They're not -- why did I say yesterday? Um, I must be tired. Um, it's last Saturday because I had been looking for Pocky, like, forever and I could never find it and the only place I -- I mean, I spent three years looking for it and never found it until I went to a Borders, and, uh, they were selling it at this Borders, so I bought, like, a box, along with -- uh, where did it go -- this book. I love this book. Uh, it's full of little cats. 
Um, just looking through here. Where my cheese burger? Where my Pocky? Where's my original flavored Pocky, huh, huh? Yeah, XXXX, you owe me a box. Mm, I'm angry. Mm, I'm going to look through here and then -- what am I doing? I -- I'm doing a video, not -- not -- I'm sorry, I'm bored. 
So I went to this Borders and I bought that I Can Has Cheezeburger book, and um, some original flavored Pocky -- I bought one box of it, and it was amazing. And then it was, like, in January, I think. I spent months up -- this is like April. It wasn't until like March I found some again, and there was only, like, one box in Borders. I mean, last time I was there they had, like, one of the by stands and they had, like, a bunch of it on there. And then I went there and then I found this one box on a bottom shelf of -- in the monger section, which made me kind of -- made me kind of ma ad. 
I'm gonna talk in a weird accent like this for the rest of my video. Huh, it's kind of like an Australian accent in a way, sounds really weird. Anyways enough of the accent. 
Um, so I was kind of mad about that because I had been waiting months and months and months and months to get up to this Borders again to buy some Pocky and I only got the one box. And they didn't have any more, so I was, like, okay, I'll just come some other time and get some. 
And so I went to Walmart and we're going down on the Asian cuisi -- cuisi -- cuisine -- is that even a word, cuisine, cuisine? Yeah, Asian cuisine section and I looked down, like, oh my God, is that -- why is there Pocky here? They had, like, one of those, you know, little box deals. I don't know, I can't really do it, my webcam doesn't let me do that kind of stuff. Uh, it was, like, one of those little box sleigh deals and it was full of Pocky. I'm, like, oh my God. So I bought, like, a bunch of Po -- a few boxes of the original flavor, so I had, like, four of the original and I got one box of strawberry. I really don't like the strawberry that well. It takes like a cross between strawberry yogurt and strawberry ice cream. It's not that I don't mind strawberry ice cream, it just doesn't taste good when it's on Pocky. 
So I was kind of, like, mad today when I lost the last three pieces of my Pocky. So now I gotta buy some more original flavor. And I was looking up on Wikipedia and they actually have some really weird flavors, which is, like uh, honey, grape, um, tangerine, five fusion berry -- whatever that is -- banana, coffee, caramel, marble royal milk tea -- whatever that is -- melon milk, honey and mi -- what? Uh, why is -- oh, honey and milk. I was gonna say -- uh, cream cheese, berry, sweet potato, crush -- which is like crunchy cracker pieces in the chocolate -- pineapple, pumpkin, hazelnut, um, soy bean flour, Brazilian pudding, blueberry and green tea. Those are some of the weird flavors that I have not seen ever. 
And if I did this when I was reading, that is because of my eyes. They are strange like that. I -- kind of do this when I am reading sometimes, I don't know why. I just do it. But yeah um, so you can buy these at, like -- like, super Walmarts in the Asian cuisine aisle. They are like a dollar thirty -- no, no, they are not a dollar thirty three. They are a dollar nine at Walmart. They are a dollar thirty three at like Borders, so, yeah. 
So a big thanks to XXXX for ruining this video for me. Thanks a lot, XXXX. Uh, so yeah, that should be it. Oh my, what is -- what's that? What's that? 
It's not full; it's always been not full. . It's always been more slow.
