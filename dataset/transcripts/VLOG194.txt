Hey, guys. It's XXXX -- um -- I know I say this in, like, every video, but I apologize for my appearance. Um -- my hair looks like a hot mess. I just realized that. Yeah -- um -- I was just gonna say, like, my appearance because I'm not wearing makeup but apparently my hair looks disgusting too. Um -- I'm getting -- well my mom cuts my hair 'cause she's fabulous. Um -- so she's chopping off, like, two or three inches tomorrow. Because as you could see it's at a very awkward length and I can't really do much with it because usually when it's, like, shorter I can scrunch it in there's this, like, fabulous wave thing and it's, like woah tototo . Or if I sleep on it wet it, like, curls and stuff -- yeah. Anyways, so I kind of, like, straightened it last night and then slept on it and my hair looks, like, so terrible. Anyways, um, whenever I'm not wearing makeup I just have on moisturizer which is why my skin looks kind of dull. I didn't put on concealer or anything -- I'm not putting concealer or all this stuff whatever. Um, I don't have one, like, micro mineral foundation. So, um, that's, like, kind of -- like -- weird. 
Um, just wanted to kind of update you guys on some stuff though. First of all, in case you didn't know I'm having a contest so you should go enter it. Um, I don't have the prizes yet but -- well I have some of them. But I want to make a video when I have every single prize. Um -- what else? Yeah, like, I'm gonna make a video when I have all the prizes that's why -- I think that's why I only have like one entry so far. Thank you for entering by the way. And thank you in advance to all the people who do enter. Because usually, like, with my last one I only had, like, a couple entries and then when I started showing prizes I would start getting more entries. And I had, like, over thirty entries with one hundred subscribers. So I was like okay how ya doing. So, um, yeah. Pretty much I, um, still have to go get it. Just because I was focusing all my money on getting Christmas presents for my family and stuff. So, um, I'll have more money after Christmas when I start babysitting again and stuff. 'cause I babysit for this family, like, on a regular basis and they said they're gonna need me, like, a week after Christmas. So, like, next week. So they're like yeah, we're gonna need you like a week after Christmas. They didn't know the exact date but they knew that they're gonna need me. So, yeah, I'll have money and then I'll go out and, um, buy prizes for the contest. Hey. Um, it is really like mostly drug store stuff. I'm not gonna go out and be like so I bought like twelve mineralized skin finishes and five thousand MAC blushes and stuff because I don't have that kind of money. I am a seventeen year old girl with, like -- well not that being a girl has anything to do with it -- whatever. I am a seventeen year old who does not have a job because I am focusing on school. 
My job is, like, babysitting and then I'm opening up my Etsy soon now that I can actually sew again because I can use my thumb. So, um, I actually went to the craft store today and -- with my mother. And got some sewing machine needles -- five -- so that's plenty of -- um -- needles fixed up. And then I got some colored feathers with, like, spots on them. And you can't even see them in here they just look really dull but I'll open them up and show you guys one of them. Hi. I'm sure that's sanitary. Everybody wants to buy them now. Um -- I'll show you one of them. Hey, here's what I could make since I'm gonna be a hot guy next year. Oh. Oh. That's when I'd really, like, apathetic -- whatever. So it's, like, they have, like, these awesome, like, feathers polka dot things. So I'm gonna be putting them onto, like, clips and headbands and stuff. And he was like -- oh my god -- like me rocking my page -- whatever -- my stuff -- whatever. Anyways, so, like, me rocking pages the cute little tiny, tiny feather. Um, so I will make, um, another video when I actually have stuff up on my Etsy telling you guys to go check it out. But this is like a pre cursor kinda thing to what I do make. 
I sew so, um, I'm gonna have, like, bags and, like, whatever on there. I might make some, like, wallet type things like pouches and stuff. I got some vintage -- um -- zippers at a local thrift store. Like, I got a bunch of them so I don't know what I'm doing with them yet. I was thinking about making clothes because I do know how to sew and, like, I have sewn my own clothes before and stuff. But it's just so hard with, like, the sizes 'cause then it's, like, if I make it and it doesn't sell because it's not the right size and somebody's like oh you know that's like a size to small or a size to big on me and I'm just, like, well that sucks because it's one of a kind -- you know what I mean? So although I do alter my own clothes and stuff, um, I'm not gonna do it on there just because it's harder to do that. 
But, um, and I also wanna start doing an installation of at sea, like, sites. Like -- I know how Kaye does her, like, beauty hairs -- you should check out. Um -- that's Kaleen's Creation. I'll put her link in the sidebar too 'cause she's fabulous, um, even though most of you probably already know who she is. Um, but if you have an at sea site send me an email and I'll check it out, um, because I do want to start, like, send me a private message on here, um, I do want to start kind of showcasing it. Just to give you a hint though most of the at sea sites I will be promoting will be, like, really bright colorful vivid ones that are like, oh my gosh, you can tell we took time and effort to make our product. Not, like, here I put some beads on a string give me twenty dollars. Now like different if they're, like, real, like, legit stuff 'cause there are some stuff like that. But when you hint -- sometimes I've looked at at seas sites and, like, you some people messages and they're like hey check out my shop and I'm like oh you're stuff's sucks. But I don't say that because that would be rude. So, um, yeah, not that my stuff's, like, the most amazing stuff in the world but, yeah, I'm just kinda like okay can you like put a little effort into your products. Like -- at sea is supposed to be stuff made with love. Not just for, like, the money. 
So, yeah, I'm gonna do that and then I knit so I'll be having hats and wrist warmers and scarves and stuff. Um, not as many of those as, like, sewing stuff and, like, stuff I can glue and what not because that does take longer. I'm gonna be having wrist cuffs which are really awesome and their kind of like -- if you're like me you'll wear them on a daily basis but some people might just wear them if they're, like, going to, like, a costumey party or something. But if you're like me you'll just wear them because you're fabulous. 
Um, I have a lot of accessories like hair bows and like hair stuff , uh, like headbands and what not and clips. Um, I'm trying to think of what else. Bracelets, necklaces, earrings -- I have all the stuff to make it already. A lot of stuff with buttons -- oh, my god -- stuff with buttons I just love. Okay. That was really creepy sounding. Anyways, so I'll have, like, a lot of stuff like that. Um -- I'm trying to think of what else. 'cause I do like a lot of stuff with, like, charms and what not and, like, sewing and buttons and feathers and my stuff is very, very colorful -- the stuff I make. So if you're, like, into color you'll probably like it. Like, if you like spotted feathers on headbands and clips you'll probably like my site. So, um, yeah, that's it for the at sea stuff. 
I am gonna be making a lot more videos after Christmas. I don't know if said this or not already 'cause I've had to make this video, like, twelve times. My little sister keeps coming in here going Paigy, Paigy. And I'm like, okay Alex, I love you but I'm trying to make a video. Um -- but I asked for a camcorder for -- blah -- for Christmas preferably a flip cam. And so if I get that I'm gonna be making videos, like, nonstop but they won't be going out nonstop just because I don't wanna be annoying like you guys let me stand with a million videos. It'll kinda be like, I'll film a couple in a day and actually take time to edit them. Because I can't really edit on my webcam. Um -- but I do have an editing system it's just kinda, like, why bother with my webcam kinda thing, you know, So I will actually be taking time to edit them and we'll be having a contest where you'll win something that I made 'cause I'm gonna want a -- um -- like, an intro thingy but let's not talk about that right now. Hmm. I'll talk about that after this contest is over. 
So, yeah, my contest is gonna end January thirty first by the way. I'm gonna go back and edit that and now in like a little bubble, like, contest ends January thirty first. Hello! Um -- so you have until January thirty first, that's over a month and it's pretty simple contest. You can either do crazy or settle, like, school spirit. So go check it out. 
Um, I'm trying to think of what else. I know I had other stuff to say but I'm forgetting it so -- yeah, um, that's pretty much it. Request, request, request. Post like a million requests in here because I have a word document with stuff it's called YouTube Stuff saved on my computer. I just like requests because if I delete a video I always check the comments to make sure because I'll get random requests that are, like, "Oh -- I know this has nothing to do with this video but could you do this? " And I'm like yes I will. So, um, the first video I kind 'a wanna make if I do get a flip cam -- of course I wanna do one with, like, hey guys here's what I got for Christmas. And then I wanna do a room tour because everybody does those room tours and I've gotten few requests to do them. I don't remember the names because it's been, like, too many people so I stopped counting. So it's like at least five people have asked me to do a room tour. So, um, I think that's it. Post requests and you can add my new MySpace that I made -- um -- because the other one was being weird. So, yeah, all the links are in the sidebar or down there if you're watching it on my main page. All right. Bye.
