Hi everybody, how you doing? It's XXXX from XXXX. Today in the Catholic Church was the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. What's the Immaculate Conception? Well, a lot of Catholics will mistakenly tell you that it was the conception of Jesus. I used to think that myself, but that's not true. That's a totally different event. That was the Annunciation. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception was the conception of our Blessed Mother into the womb of Saint Anne, her mother. Well, what was so immaculate about that, you might ask. 
Well, we're going to have to go back in time to Adam and Eve, the very first two people on Earth. Now, we all know the story. Adam and Eve they ate the fruit and they caused humanity to fall into sin, okay. So therefore, as punishment, every offspring of Eve and Adam would be born into sin. That includes you and I and all of our children and our children's children. Okay? 
So, we are all born in original sin. We have that on our souls that's why -- that's the purpose of Baptism to get rid of that sin. All right? Now, we believe that God spared our Lady of being born with original sin. 
﻿This is all of us. Pretend we're these soda cans, okay? Just imagine -- pretend that these are people, okay? And then this bowl here --
Has a lot of popcorn in it. 
-- Uh, is sin, okay? When we're born, we fall into the -- we fall into the original sin. Okay. Can you hear that? These are -- this is us when we're -- our conceptions, okay? All of us -- all of us are into that -- are -- are born with that original sin, okay, all of us. Woo, woo, woo. 
Alright. Now, when it was Mary's turn, Jesus, being Mary's savior, did save her. He spared her into going into the original sin, from being born into the original sin. So yes, he is still her savior, it just worked a little bit differently, alright? Her -- she was born with -- she was born sinless, okay, thanks to Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit. Thanks to the Holy Trinity, okay. So Jesus is her savior. The rest of us were redeemed by Jesus after our births with Baptism, confession, and everything. 
Uh, if anyone's interested in seeing a movie about it, there's a great one I recommend. It's called, um, The Song of Bernadette. It's in black and white, but it's a beautiful, beautiful picture. Go to Blockbuster. Go to Hollywood Video. They all have it. Um, check the, uh, I guess the oldie movies or something like that. It was made in, like, I don't know, like, the fifties or sixties or something like that. It's black and white. But, um, beautiful picture and he explains it -- explains what the whole Our Lady of Lords and the Immaculate Conception is. 
Alright. I hope I didn't cause any more confusion with that. I tried to do my best. But thank you anyway, and have a great week.
