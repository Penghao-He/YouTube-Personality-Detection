We're going to deal with the subject of Islam. Uh, it has come to my attention that obviously you have a wide range of understanding of the key apologetic issues amongst the Muslim People. Some have little to no understanding at all and -- and some are a little more read. Uh, but when it comes to popular Islam, it seems that the most popular name today is Zakir Naik. 
Now, he of course as we have demonstrated in previous videos, is pretty much just continuing, ah, the work of Ahmed Deedat. His arguments are sometimes word for word identical to Ahmed Deedat and what concerns me is I don't see a lot of evidence that Doctor Naik has gone beyond Ahmed Deedat. Um, especially, in the fact, that, well many people have demonstrated that Ahmed Deedat made many fundamental, basic errors that really, um, for a serious Christian, make his apologetics, um, well, significantly less than compelling, shall we say, might be the nicest way to put it. Uh, bogus would be the more modern way of putting it. 
Uh, we have documented many of uh, Ahmed Deedat's errors in the past on this YouTube channel. Um, but Dr. Zakir Naik continues to use the same type of argumentation and basically goes like this. You say Jesus never said, I am God, worship me. Um, then you run through an entire list of out of context verses and you do it really, really fast, so that you are really impressing, um, the Muslim audience, but not the Christian audience that actually knows their Scriptures. 
Now if you're talking to a Christian that doesn't know their bible, they can be totally blown away by someone who can just pull verses very, very quickly. Of course anybody can do that with a Koran too and I suppose in that way, uh, impress Muslims who don't know their Scriptures very well. 
But from a Christian perspective, that wouldn't be an appropriate thing to do. That would not honor Allah, the truth, would it? Because that's sort of, what politicians do, not what people who are dealing with God's truth do. 
And so, I was directed recently to the appearance of Zakir Naik on the Deen Show . Now we have interacted with the Deen Show before, I realized when I was starting to look at this that I never finished one series I was doing when I was going through the top ten reasons why Jesus isn't God. It's amazing how much time, uh, the Deen Show spends on, well, attacking Christianity. Um, rather than other things, but maybe that's just because that's what I'm directed to. You know, I could -- that could be a possibility. Um, I -- I will leave that out there, that's something that is a possibility, but they do, do it a lot and in this clip, this session with Zakir Naik first thing they go for is that particular subject. 
But in the process Dr. Zakir Naik once again demonstrates that neither he nor Ahmed Deedat actually understand the doctrines of trinity. Uh, they do not understand the presentation of the doctrine, they do not understand historically, they do not understand it biblically. 
And if Zakir Naik is the best known Islamic apologist, what does that say? Shouldn't the best known Islamic apologist at least be accurate in his statements concerning the doctrine of the trinity? Wouldn't just simple truth and honesty and even just respect require that? 
I -- I think it would, so we're going to look at what Zakir Naik had to say and provide a response and, um, once again I would love to see someone arrange an opportunity to debate Zakir Naik. Um, maybe over more than one night because there are some very important topics to address and it would be very useful, I think, to find out can this man actually go beyond the speed reading of verses and actually deal with the text as it was originally written against someone who knows that text well? 
That's what I would like to find out. I would be honored to have that opportunity of defending the gospel of Jesus Christ in that context. We would be very happy to see that happen. 
So let's take a look at, um, Zakir Naik. We start, uh, with the host of the program, seems like a really nice guy, Eddie , um, wouldn't want to mess with him, seems like a pretty big guy, guess he's into martial arts and stuff like that. Um, but he -- notice his description of Zakir Naik as the Doctor of Dawa . I'm not just the one saying here is the big man, this -- this should be the most accurate presentation that we find that's what the Muslims themselves are saying. Let's take a look at it. 
By popular demand, people have been requesting, people have been asking why don't you have this man on the show. And you know what? Today he's here, the true Doctor AbDawa , Doctor Zakir Naik, when we come back. You don't want . 
I mean yes, so we're going to get straight to the topic. There's some confusion out there. People are worshiping the sun. They're worshiping the moon. They're worshiping a man. So in this particular show, because you're expert on this topic, we want to give the top reasons why the creator of the heavens and the earth, God almighty, in Arabic we say, Allah, is not a man, never was a man, never tried to be a man. 
If you analyze, uh, all the major religion of the world except for Islam, all the other major religions of the world they believe that almighty God became a human being once or a number of times. Yes, all the major religions except Islam they believe that almighty God, either once or many times became a human being. And they believe in a philosophy knows as Anthropomorphism. 
Uh huh. 
Anthropomorphism means that almighty God taking forms and he becomes a human being and then we ask them why does almighty God have to become a human being? So they say that almighty God he's so holy, he's so pure, he's so noble, he does not know the shortcomings of the human being. 
Uh huh. 
He does not know how they make me feel when he's hurt, when he's angry, when it requires certain things. He doesn't know the requirements of the human being, how do they feel, et cetera. That's the reason almighty God came into this world and became a human being to know what is good or what is bad for the human being. 
Uh huh. 
On the face of it, it sounds to be a very good logic, oh almighty God, so holy, so pure, so noble, does not know the shortcomings of the human being, does not know how human being feels when he is hurt, when he has problems, so it sounds to be good. 
Yeah. 
And I tell them that suppose I had been to manufacture a DVD player. 
Yeah. 
I created a DVD player, but because I'm a manufacturer for DVD player, do I have to become a DVD player to know what is good or what is bad for the DVD player. How is it? Because I am the manufacturer, I'm the creator I don't have to become a DVD player, what do I do? I write the instruction manual. 
Exactly. 
But if you want to play the DVD inside the DVD and then press the play button. 
Yes. 
If you want to skip, press the skip button, if you want to stop, press the stop button. I don't have to become a DVD player to know what is good or the bad for the DVD player, because I am the creator. Similarly, almighty God he is the creator of the human being, so he does not have to become a human being to know what is good or the bad for the human being. What does he do? He chooses a man amongst men and he communicates with them on a higher level, who we call a messenger . He doesn't have to come himself and the last and final message, the last and final instruction manual for the man is the Koran. 
Now this wasn't really the central aspect of my concerns about what Doctor Naik says. Uh, however, I've never argued that the incarnation is based upon God needing to know what it's like to be a man. Um, that's not a biblical presentation. 
The necessity of the incarnation really has to do with God's decree and with the means by which forgiveness of sins is provided and that is through the sacrifice of Christ and the union of God's people with Christ. Those are all important things, but it's not God needed to know what it's like to be a man, that's just not a biblical presentation. And so I have to wonder who it is that Eddie is talking about or that Zakir Naik is talking about when he talks about people, uh, saying these things that, uh, well God needed to become a man so he could know what it's like to be a man. Um, that's just simply not a Christian perspective. 
Uh, at this point then Doctor Naik goes into his how many completely out of context verses can I fire off at you, very, very quickly so as to impress your routine and so we're going to listen to this. So you can get the effect, you can understand, you know, um, why someone who is ignorant of the Bible might find this to be very, uh, impressive or weighty. Uh, but then look at the text and see that Doctor Naik is not dealing with the bible in any kind of serious fashion, uh, but is just giving, uh -- uh -- uh, a standard form of -- of argumentation. 
now tell us, now it's known commonly that people take Wanda is beloved to our hearts, when we love him as one of the mightiest messengers of God the many are claiming that he said he was God, that he's --
