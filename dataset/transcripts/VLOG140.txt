Hey, it's still Monday and this is my first official XXXX video. Now you might ask, what is a XXXX? Well this is a XXXX. Do you understand now? It's a wall covered in Post its. But each Post it contains a tinny amount of awesome. And it's just amazing. Basically I live in the coolest dorm ever and whenever something amazing goes down or we have a new inside joke or something just amazing happens I write it on a Post it and I date it and I tape it to the Post it wall. And so everyday I am going to be explaining a Post it to you. Today's Post it is this one. 
I'm a really a big fan of the snap pictures jump cut thing. But anyway that Post it said I like to think of Jesus as a mischievous badger. Ten points if you know where the quote came from but, it's not really about where the quote came from. Basically we became addicted to this website called MLIA, its mylifeisaverage. com and it really should be my life is awesome because it's just all these stories about cool stuff that happened in people's lives. And it's better than fuck my life because instead of laughing at people's sadness you're laughing at people's awesome. 
Anyway a lot of them are about the Google game which is, like, where you put in a phrase and then you see what pops up first. You know, like, I think I like -- I blah or whatever -- and whatever comes up first is just usually hilarious. And so we put in, I like to think of and up came Jesus as a mischievous badger. And so that is the official first Post it on the Post it wall. That is where the Post it wall idea came from and it is super fun. 
Tomorrow I will be telling you about the second Post it on the XXXX and then the next day I will be telling you about the third. It's just really cool and it's -- a lot of you know you wouldn't get it if you weren't there stories, but you know what? They're still awesome and they'll still make you laugh. So tune in. And that's my first Post it wall video. I like it. 
I'm playing with my flat bracelet. I found it on our counter and I was, like, what the fuck? I'm going to steal Weasy Waiters flat bracelet idea as I did in the first video today. And now I'm playing with it because it makes fun noises. I like it. I will see you in a minute when I make my third video. God, this is going to eat my life. Bye.
