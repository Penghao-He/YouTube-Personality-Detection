And, uh, it was really cool, . I met my friend from, uh, that I hadn't seen in like months. I met her friends, and they are really cool; and halfway through, we stood up because we were right in the front and they didn't want to be; they wanted to go to the back, so they went to the back, so me and my other friend were like stuck. We were like, this high in a mosh about people who are like, this high. We were just like looking up at them, like, hi! It wasn't that violent, like, people didn't like, bash you or anything because you just like, -- if people tried pushing, you would just swipe them and push them away. Fuck you, . 
So it was all good. There were these really scary lasses who liked screaming out, yes, because they wanted to get in front of us, so we moved away because we didn't want to get bashed , so we walked away, and I need to get my photos developed. I will get them developed tomorrow and put them up. Um, I haven't made a video in ages, and I'm sorry, . Kids opened up , and they were really cool, and I got a picture of the really hot guitarist. Um, and I've got a really busy weekend. 
Tomorrow I'm seeing XXXX again, and then in the night I'm going to my friend's party, and then on Sunday I have Animal Farm rehearsals, and then I just have to do all my homework in the night, and that's going to be exciting. 
I drew some things in class this time, and I really wanted to show you, but I couldn't find it. I drew this picture that I digitalized. I stayed up -- that was the first time I had stayed up on a school night until, uh, all night, um, just on my laptop just speaking to people who wouldn't let me go to sleep, so I went there, and then I did a period monster during Hebrew and geography. 
Um, I'm going to camp in a couple of weeks. Woop, woop! I'm going to music camp with the musos , and I'm going to film that stuff because the people I'm going with are really cool people, and then I'm going camping with my friends, and I'll be , and then, for my links sidebar, and I'll put my Tumblr because I need Tumblr followers because I fail at Tumblr followers.
