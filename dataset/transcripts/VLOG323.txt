Oh my God, you guys! It has been forever since I have made a video. I was going to this whole, like, I'm not making a video until you guys all make a video, but I figured that wasn't going to happen. So, how've you guys been? It's been forever. I don't like not seeing you. I miss all of you so much. 
I have a couple of personal messages. Terry , email me because genuinely, I will keep text messaging you until I get an email. Actually, I think I need to do that right now. 
Raquel. I am so excited for your book. I have been reading all your and it's making me so happy because you're finally almost finished. And I really, really want a copy, like ridiculously bad. So, if you want someone to read it or you want someone to praise you like crazy, you can send me an advanced copy. 
Dan, I know that I've been messaging you and I don't know if you're gonna watch this, but I love you and I hope you're all good and that you're coping okay, 'cause I know it's such a terrible time for you right now. But I hope that you're okay. 
Mimi. Oh my God, did I read that you're in New York? How exciting is that? And you've met like way more famous people than I have. Or seen more famous people. I didn't see any famous people and I -- I was disappointed, genuinely disappointed. I didn't see anybody in England. 
James, I know you're really busy with school, I believe, so, hope that's all going okay. 
Yven. What has been going on with you? I don't really know you. I haven't seen much of you, so let me know please. 
I'm going to Sydney for a week which should be amazing. I love Sydney so much, so that will be fun and not much else has really been going on. 
My dad has got dementia it turns out. It's like, a really rare form. It's like, in the frontal tempal lobe or something. I don't know, it's confusing and it's complicated and it's kinda sucky, but I'm doing okay. My mom is pretty awesome, it turns out. I didn't think I'd like her as much as I doing which is amazing. She's really up on everything I do. 
So, I will see you guys whenever I make a video next. 
Um, but I do miss you a lot, so try and make some videos.
