Hey, do you want a chocolate cupcake? Seriously, do you? Ahh. So hey guys, it's blog time again. You haven't had a blog in a while, have you? Well, here's one now. 
Quick question, though. Has anyone ever had a spot on their butt that just won't go away? It's annoying, isn't it? 
So basically, this is just a little clip -- why can't I talk? Seriously, why? Well, enough about me, what have you guys been up to? I want to know everything. Like everything, did you have a shower today or a bath? What shampoo did you use? Herbal Essences? Oh yeah. 
Okay, I really don't care that much about what you've been up to. This is just to let you know that I have, uh, quite a few videos in the making. Um, I'm sorry I've been a bit dead over the past couple of weeks. Among other things, it's Halloween, um, but yeah, I've been fairly busy with college et cetera. College is going well. 'Cause we've been putting to bands and stuff, uh, like little college bands today -- like half an hour cover set for a game they're playing at Christmas. If any of you live around the Oxford area, um, you can come see me play on the eighteenth of December, at the Oxford and Cherwell Valley College. If you want -- if you want details of it, you could send me a message on YouTube and I'll be happy to reply. 
Do you like my makeshift mike stand? Hello, hello. 
So I've got two more things to talk about. One is a little bit of I'm going to do. One of my friends is an amazing pianist, like seriously amazing. I have two friends that are amazing pianists. I'd say both of them -- the first one is my friend Simon. If you've been on my channel recently or you follow me on Twitter, you may have noticed that I put up a -- pigeonal go go of exposure poo, a legend on the piano medley that he did. It's really good, really nice to listen to and he's just -- he's just an amazing pianist. Did I mention he's an amazing pianist? If you say pianist five times very fast, it ends up sounding like penis. Pianist, pianist, pianist, pianist, pianist. Ahh seriously, I've just realized that. I'm a genius. 
But seriously, go check in the sidebar for that. Rate it comment on it, 'cause it's an amazing medley, like really, yeah. And the other user is DarkMoonCoversNineteen, um the -- there should be a little uh, annotation that appears on the screen. Oh, there is. The fact is what is putting in the sidebar, why don't we just throw the link up to the other video, which is there. You see it? You see it? And poof it's gone. And so is the other one, poof. Um, I'm weird aren't I? Yeah, you are a bit. Well, there's no need to be like that. Anyway, and the second thing. I have been recording a song -- a song, you know, like a song, song that I wrote. So I'm gonna be like, the next Dave from Blue Skies. Ha, ha, ha, no obviously not. But here's a small little clip of the rough mix now. That'll do. So the final mix of that song, along with the music video should be up this weekend or the beginning of next week, so something for you to look forward to. Me singing and playing guitar. Whoo. Suck it XXXX.
