Today is going to be a very different video than any video that I've done before. It's because today, I'm going to be asking you for help. Now during the summer of 2009, the group XXXX got together and we decided that it would be really, really good for us and good for the community if we got together and did a charity event. 
Now we went through a lot of charity ideas, lot of different organizations, great organizations, but the one that we actually came up with in the end to raise funds for was the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We came up with that one specifically for two reasons. 
Number one, they are at the forefront of science research to eliminate cancer from our society. The second reason was their direct involvement with children. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital works directly with children and never turns a child away because of their inability to pay the bill. 
So, many cases, all over the United States, children who are sick and stricken down with cancer and really need some serious help, but they don't have the ability to pay, can go there and get world class treatment without the worrying of being able to pay for some of the experimental treatments or some of the great care that they get at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 
Now, we batted around a lot of ideas also as far as what to actually do, what kind of charity to do. Now a few months ago, a lot of you remember that DPR did a great charity event, a twenty four hour marathon to raise money for Doctors Without Borders. Now we had thought about that honestly, um, as a way to raise money, but that was kind of the idea that cemented it. So what we're going to do is this. We're going to take the basic premise of a charity marathon on blog TV and we're going to up the ante a little bit. We are going to up the ante in several ways. 
First off, we are going to be asking for donations. We have a page set up and a link to that page will be in the side bar. This is a page set up directly through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, so as soon as you make a contribution, one hundred percent of that money will go directly to them and go right to work helping cancer research and helping children who need it. 
The second thing that we're going to be doing is the eBay channel. Now that is an idea that we did directly steal from DPR and sorry for that. Um, I spoke with him and he said it's for a great charity then go for it. We're going to be donating items directly for that and we're also going to be asking for items that you would like to donate to go on to the eBay channel and one hundred percent of the money that we get from that, will go directly also to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 
Now the final way that we're going to collect money is this. When you were in school, a lot of you remember doing rockathons or walkathons or mathathons. That's similar to what we're going to do for our final stage. What it comes down to is this. On the eighteenth of December, that's a Friday morning, I'm gonna to wake up and I'm gonna to sit down in front of the camera. 
The charity event itself has no time limit whatsoever. I will continue to talk, I will continue to bring on co hosts, I will read papers, I will read articles, I'll discuss issues. Anything that I can do to stay awake and to keep going. We're asking people to pledge money, X amount of dollars or X amount of cents for every hour that I stay on and then at the end when I actually finish, when my head literally hits the keyboard, that's going to be the stop time. Then we'll multiply however much you pledged times how many hours we lasted and that will be your donation amount. 
Um, I understand that this is going to happen on December eighteenth. That's another hiccup that we've come up with, um, throughout many hiccups actually, so I understand the time frame of Christmas being right there. That's why we're not going to ask for the donations until the thirtieth of January. 
At the -- on the thirtieth of January, that's when we will ask for all the donations to be in, so we'll do a final check cut and send that directly to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and we'll also be clearing out the bank account showing that on camera also as a little field trip exercise, to actually head to Memphis and to uh, give it to them personally, to make sure that they get every penny that you donate. 
Now, what we're doing now is, uh, we've reserved a hotel room to start us off in, so we're going to be broadcasting this from somewhere, not here, where we can actually have people. We're going to be doing a cooking show. We've got a bunch of things planned that go beyond just me sitting in front of a camera. Uh, so I'll be showing you my famous spinach lasagna. Um, we'll be cooking that. We'll also have a grab bag, but more details about all of that stuff will come in the following weeks. 
I'm going to try to plan to do one video every week showing you the progress and whose, uh, whose in for co hosting and little things that we have planned. 
So, for now, what I wanted to leave you with is the general idea of what we're planning to do. We're also going to be asking for co hosts, anybody who wants to come on. If you find a great news article, if you have something that you just really want to discuss and get opinions on, feel free to send us a PM or send an email. I'm going to put the email right here, right about now, so that you can see it. So it will be occamsrazorsua at yahoo dot com. We're looking forward to getting your ideas, we want to know what you think about it. We would love to have, um, as many articles, as many things, as many topics, as many issues as we can raise in this time frame. 
Now I'm going to say again, this has no time limit whatsoever. We start on Friday morning. When we end simply depends on when I can't talk anymore or when I can't blog anymore or when I can't continue. 
So, like I said before, we'll be doing more videos to update you as we get more information and thank you for watching this and stay tuned for this little quick snippet. 
Oh, I won't back down, no, I won't back down. You can stand me up at the gates of Hell, but I won't back down. No, I won't back down, my feet turned around, in a world that keeps on pushing me around, I'm gonna stand my ground. And I won't back down. I won't back down, baby. There ain't no easy way out, but I, I will stand my ground and I won't back down. 'Cause I know. . . 
So what we're asking for now is for people to give us a hand, to volunteer to co host, to moderate the chat, to donate money, to donate items, to pledge money, to mirror this video. Basically, we're asking for anyone who can give us a hand with making this a really good charity to please do so. 
So, my only question to you is, who's in? 
Oh, baby, there ain't no easy way out.
