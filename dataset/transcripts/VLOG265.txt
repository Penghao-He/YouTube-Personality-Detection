Hey guys, it's Saturday, January thirty first and I'm really sick and I'm going to make this brief because moviemaker hasn't been working all week and I have fallen pretty ill, um, I have swollen tonsils and I'm losing my voice anytime I talk too much. My nose is running, I'm coughing and I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend, namely revise papers for a prestigious program I'm trying to complete. Um, do normal homework, work and, um, do chores around the house and so, I'm sorry. I'm going to try and make a better vlog hopefully at my mom's house or at my boyfriend's house, but it's just looking like my computer's sick and I'm sick, which altogether leaves to a horrible project. Have a good weekend. I hope I have a good weekend and I will see you as soon as I can. Bye.
