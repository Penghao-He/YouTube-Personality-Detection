Hey, guys. Totally just trying to make a blog. This is awkward for me, 'cause I haven't made a blog in a while 
Hey, let me just talk to an imaginary person. This camera's not gonna respond. It's just gonna get all weird, and it's gonna be like, you're an idiot. 
Hey, first totally something exciting that I should share with you guys. Totally have a job. That means I'm making money. I'm actually gonna be a tutor at my old middle school. I noticed that there is a big difference between when I was in middle school, and then the kids that are in middle school now. 
First of all, they're freaking tall. I feel like a midget. I mean, I was a midget when I was in middle school -- I was only like, four feet and eight inches -- I only grew, like, what, three inches since then, I don't know. I'm standing next to these like, five nine kids, and I'm like, I look like I'm four eleven, basically. And all these kids are like, um, you're my tutor? I'm like, yeah, nice to meet you. 
They have a laptop program at this school. I don't know if that's or what, but they're like -- I didn't need a laptop 'til I was in college, and I had been working for, like two to three years, I don't know. I don't really think a laptop is that necessary in middle school, but I guess times are a changing. 
Speaking of laptops, I'm taking notes with my laptop now, but this dude next to me had his laptop out, and was like, pounding away at the keys. It was like tappety, tap, tap so loud, like hey, can you, like, cut pillows on your fingers, like mini cotton balls or something, to like mute the sound of your little -- your fingers, so I can -- distracting. 
So yes. Along with that, I have also just started school. A lot of you guys have already been to school for, like, a few weeks, but I just started this week at my, uh -- at my university. I go to by the way. Hopefully, soon I will be graduating, if I pass all these classes and I'm, like, good to go. Since I am back in school, that means less time for making these videos and, um, I do apologize for that, but hey, I have a life too. I mean, I appreciate that you guys watch these videos, but you should get some sunshine. 
I might not have enough time to make videos, so if you guys are really that interested in whatever the heck I have to say, I did make a blog, d seven one two three blogspot dot com. Hopefully, it won't be too long before my next video, but in the meantime just check out the bloggy blog. And also, I promised Mika that I would say hi to her in a video, so hello Mika, thank you for the funnel cake that I've , you can make a . 
. Okay, lame.
