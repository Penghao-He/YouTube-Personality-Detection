Hi, everybody. I don't have my glasses on. Um, where are my glasses? Oh my God, in the middle of getting wetty. Wetty. . I was trying to upload another happy video and it was like such a big file, so I'm like, I have, ah, something else. Other things made me happy today. It's super early in my day, so you guys can do this at the end of the day if you want to wait. I'm begging for the picture replies on DailyBooth link on the side. If you don't have a video camera and you want to do, um, just picture replies and things that may, oh my God, Colin is making me happy today. 
Um, but the three things -- I already have three things in my head that are making me happy today. Number one is this sweater. A lot of you always pick clothes and I think it's cool to have, you know, if you have a pair of jeans on, or a sweat -- this is a fall sweater; truly a fall sweater. So, I love this sweater. I haven't worn this all year, so I'm wearing this today, and it's making me happy. I'm like, yeah, fall sweater. Guys, now knock it off. Um, so I love my sweater; that's one. 
Two, I just finished Ally McBeal Season Four last night -- when Larry leaves. He's gonna -- Larry left. He's gonna leave a note. She kept saying that. He's gonna leave a note. So I love Ally McBeal. And now I know Season Five isn't very good, but tonight I'm ready to watch Season Five on DVD with all of the new characters. Whatever. 
I realize that a lot of TV shows that I've enjoyed over the years, like Glee, and Ally McBeal, have a musical component. You know, I just -- I love the musical aspect of Ally McBeal. Um, so that's two things. I'm very excited. I -- I -- you know, every night -- it's joy watching -- but you might hear this every day; I might mention TV and what joy TV brings me every day, but Ally McBeal brings me joy on DVD every day. Um, why? They're all -- they're all yelling at me. 
And number three, I'm going to meet Gary today -- Gary Vaynerchuk -- who's, uh, book is out, Crush It! And he's doing a book signing and he's actually doing it at my former place of employment. Isn't that funny? So I'm going back to my old stomping grounds where I used to work. And he will be there. And I'm going to have him sign my books. 
Stop that! Um, I dunno why they're --knock it off! I'm sorry, they're -- I -- I don't-- I'm sorry; I'm not really a yeller, but I -- I -- it's just -- it's a habit because I'll be doing What the Buck, and I'll hear them and I'll be like, shut up. And I know that's -- that's rude but, they're dogs. I love you with all my heart. Elie's in the chair. 
Um, so any -- anyway I can't weet to mate -- whoop, I can't meet to wait -- I can't wait to meet Gary today. I'm super excited. Um, anyways. Elie, Elie can you say hi? She thinks she's a person. Do you see her? She sits on the chair, sitting next to me. Don't you remember you told me you love me baby? She's very special. Um, so what made you guys happy today? Leave a comment, make a video reply, make a photo reply, and, um, this is a fun way to blog my What the Buck show, which is an interview with Carey Perseen , will be up soon. Happiness. It's so easy. Be happy every day. Find things to be happy about.
