Hi, it's XXXX, this is XXXX. I just want to check in and let y'all know about my vegan Thanksgiving. It was fantastic. This year I celebrated with a group of people at a potluck -- a vegan potluck. Um, it was a little bit different because in the past whenever I've done a vegan potluck, it's been uh, before Thanksgiving day, and then Thanksgiving day, I celebrate it with my family. My family happens to be vegetarian and vegan, so I've always had a vegetarian or vegan Thanksgiving. 
So it's not unusual for me to omit the turkey um, and I don't -- I've never felt a need to substitute it. But the last few years uh, because of marriage and other circumstances, there've been a few more omnivores in our family and um, I felt compelled to provide alternative options for them. And also it's just fun to experiment with faux meats. So I did try a tofurkey one year, and uh, again this -- this year we had a tofurkey at our potluck. And it's okay, I think it's just fine. I actually prefer uh, Tofurky brand products uh, that are not the actual tofurkey. I like their sausages and stuff like that, but I don't really like their turkey substitute that they make for Thanksgiving. I prefer instead something called Celebration Roast that's made by a company called Field Roast, so we had that at our table as well. 
We also had a dish that was like a homemade seitan dish that um, I don't even know who brought it. But it was pretty good um, and that worked as another one of our main dishes. We had just a bunch of main dishes; it was crazy. 
Um, we also had lots of traditional foods. We had yams and we had um, pumpkin pie, you know and all those kinds of things, which it's very easy to make most of the traditional Thanksgiving side dishes vegan. Or uh, at the very least it's very easy to make them vegetarian, but it's pretty easy to make them vegan. Just substitute stuff like margarine for butter or you use olive oil instead of butter. Um, you know you can soy sour cream, you can get vegan mayonnaise, you can get vegan versions of a lot of, um -- a lot of the products you might use in a lot of your side dishes. Or just try to do it just a little more healthfully and omit a lot of the fatty substances and make it just plain vegetables or just plain beans or something like that. 
We had a -- speaking of beans, we had a three bean stew that was really good. I love that. Um, that's something that my mom makes and -- and uh, I really liked it. So that was good. Um, what else did we have? We had um, geez, we had so many different things. 
We had, like, five different desserts. Like I said we had three or four main dishes. We had a whole bunch of sides. I didn't even try everything, and normally in a potluck that's the whole point, right? To try -- at least try everything, take a spoon or a fork from every offering but um, that just wasn't possible. There was too much food -- way too much food. It was really good to celebrate also with other vegans. 
It's important to reconnect with our community and to know that we're not alone and you know, share ideas and thoughts and experiences. So that was nice to be part of Thanksgiving and that I could give thanks to be part of this wonderful community of people who are so thoughtful and compassionate and um, just good and joyous. 
So, uh, anyway that was my Thanksgiving. I hope you had a fabulous Thanksgiving and um, take care. Bye.
