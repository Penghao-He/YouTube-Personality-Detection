Hi. Yeah, I keep cranking them out don't I? Uh huh. Okay, where was I? Yes. Maybelline lipsticks. These are the plumping kind, the plumping excel or whatever the devil that they call them but they're not going to be around anymore so I grabbed all I could see. They were like three something a piece whatever. This particular color I'm showing you is number one forty. Petal Attraction. They don't even swatch, so, yeah, they have that rough edge to them still. This one is six forty, Caramelizing Coffee and they're in no particular order, smells good though. seven twenty, Sultry Sienna. I did try one however and it was tingly, definitely seemed tingly. This is one eighty, Airy Desirable. This guy here is three twenty, Passionate Plum. That's pretty, that's gonna look really good on even if it's sheers 'cause I don't know what's going on. Five twenty, Crimson Crush. I'm probably going to run out of time, so if cuts off, it just cut off, and I have to come back but I'll go until it stops. This guy here six twenty in the nude. That gonna look good too. two twenty, Mische -- Mischievous Mall. One more. I thought there was like ten of them but there's like nine colors. This is Peach Plump, number one twenty. So, yeah. Getting down to the wire now, I found -- I got an absolute pencil and Blue Nile so this one's part of my absolute collection of pencils, I'll finally get the rest of those at one point. And, make up remover that I got for after Halloween and fancy maker's white polish, after Halloween of course. Show all of that. These are two LA colors. Face powders, one of them I have in natural, the other one I have in dark. 'cause I'm gonna take this -- some of it anyway -- and mix it with other things and see whether or not I can make different shades with it. Jordana is also getting rid of certain things as far as lip pencils and so on is concerned, so this is a hot pepper, natural, sweet plum, rich chocolate.
