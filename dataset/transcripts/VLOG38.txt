Hello, XXXX YouTube subscribers. I'm doing a prize giveaway, just for you guys. First prize is going to be a full copy of Sony Vegas Pro, fantastic software that will let you make your own video masterpieces. I also have three copies of Michel Gondry's book. You'll like this one, because you're in it. Michel Gondry is of course the director of "Be Kind, Rewind" and this book is all about making movies with your friends, for your friends. 
Here's how you enter. So at the end of every episode, I'd like to have a new viewer doing something like this. Hi, this is Curvy in New York. You just watched XXXX; find us on the web at XXXX dot tv. 
So, that's the gist. Do something like that, in any fashion you like. The winners will be chosen randomly, this is not competitive. So to enter, you can do a video response down below or just email your videos to me at XXXX at XXXX dot tv . 
That's it, have fun. Later.
