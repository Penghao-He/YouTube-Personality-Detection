I'm on holiday this week. Um, the company I work for is currently on strike which is all over the news anyway. Um, you know. Luckily the public is starting to realize what really is going on. Um, you know there's some support there. It's kind of um, it's all been sort of orchestrated by high level people; I can't go into too much because it's a bit political and um, obviously I work for them so I'm not gonna sort of go on about it. But I think this is -- th -- th -- this -- the news has been really funny all day alright, but just a minute ago apparently, due to the postal strikes 'cause the swine flu vaccination thing started on Monday I think, they hadn't received all the doses they was expecting due to the postal strikes. 
Please. We don't deliver vaccines. What, what. That's just -- they just said that on the news. And I'm like oh, they might have to ring people with severe illnesses, to let them come in for the vaccine because of the postal strike. And I'm like if anything, that's probably a good thing for the public because if anyone has the vaccine, it's not the best move, um, obviously you've got freedom of speech and it's down to you as an individual and if you want to take the vaccine take the vaccine but, um, I don't see that as a problem. 
The other thing is, um, last night we've got a party in this country, we've got a few parties, we've got Conservative Party, Labour Party, Green Party, Lib. Dems. , I think there's a Legalize Cannabis Party. There used to be the Raving Looney party and then -- oh what's the other one -- um there's the British National Party which is the BNP which is the one that um, was deemed racist. Still is a bit, well it is quite a lot to be honest. It's even against gay people, you know, and not just racist. Um, and there's another one, um, that's something to do with the United Kingdom. I can't -- British Independent I think it's called. Anyway, the BNP were on this program called Question Time which is on BBC where basically the public can ask questions because they've got more seats, they were allowed on it. And there was a riot outside BBC, saying don't show this man on telly because um he's racist and whatever else. Now because we live in quite a diverse country England, we've got every race possible here, um. You know after the War a lot of different cultures were brought over to this country etcetera, etcetera and obviously the second and third generations are here. 
There's also a lot of asylum seekers, um, people who have immigrated from Eastern Bloc and things like that. And. They're not bad Polish, really, but most of the Polish work and try and sort of make their own sort of sit on benefit. Asylum seekers piss me off because they're the sort of people who come over here, oh my God, you know my life's so shit, er, er. I need to come to your country and then try and change our country to how shit their country is. That doesn't make any sense to me. But, he was on telly and I'm not really a supporter of him, but he did make a couple of true statements in some respects about how the Muslim faith is perceived in the sense of um that women are second class citizens in that faith, that if you're not of Muslim faith then you're an infidel or something. He referred to a few things there that you know, um, a lot of English people relate to you know, when in Rome do as the Romans do. I have absolutely no problem with what someone's culture is, but just don't enforce it upon me because if I wanted to live in a say Indian culture, I'd go to India and live. I wouldn't move to India because I couldn't be who I am because their culture I'd have to respect it. So that's the only problem I have with race. Um, but some people see that as racist apparently. I think everyone's racist to some extent, aren't they? 
In the middle of a crisis if you had a load of black people and a load of Chinese people, and a load of white people, you'd find that if there was some kind of -- something happened between the two cultures, they'd blame the other culture and stick together. It's human nature, I think even animals do it. This doesn't mean you're racist. It's when you're aggressive toward
Stop smiling in the background. 
Hello. 
Um, who's this? What's the other thing? What was on the news as well? Oh the weather forecast. Please. Get. What. What. Right today he's quite normal, no chem. trails, quite warm for October twenty third to be honest. Apparently it's going to be fourteen degrees tonight, you know it's been above three every night this week. There's gonna be fourteen degrees tonight, excuse me. And there's torrential rain on its way that's gonna get the whole of England. And then, from tomorrow there's gonna be this effect of wind that's doing this, this big fucking either tornado that's getting quicker and quicker in the middle, that looks like a tornado. Oh, and gale force winds and torrential rain and a weather warning to finish it. You know sorry, but that was a bit of a weird weather forecast. 
Seriously, if you get a chance check it today, 'cause it was just like what? Do you know what I mean? So and then -- in Leeds, right, the Post Office are on strike. The bin men are on strike. What was the other thing? 
South Yorkshire, the firemen there. . . 
Oh yeah, the firemen are on strike. It's like okay, um. What was the other thing? Oh yeah, the Land Revenue I think in Norfolk maybe going on strike or to industrial action if something isn't sorted out to do with job loss. UK's recession seeks supplantive culture of economal -- economical decline. Our GDP has plummeted by naught point four percent and therefore it's gonna rise, right? You know, I've been going on to everyone, we're not out of no -- there's no financial collapse has happened yet. Just wait 'cause it's gonna be fucking horrendous right? All this bullshit they've done has done nothing, which we all knew it would do nothing and now it's all escalating. Watch it escalate more and more, and more and more. 
I've gotta go -- I've gotta work work four days a week now for the next however it is until they stop fucking striking. I personally still think we should just take Royal Mail's mail out and bollocks to the others, to the regulator, you know. At the end of the day I think the nearer to Christmas it comes, I think postmen might even do that. Um, I don't know. But yeah, it's all a bit of a mess. Um, I don't know if there's anything else. Is there anything else that's gone on this week? 
I don't think so. 
It's just all -- it's the first time I've seen the sky for four days. It's all like autumny, look. You can see that we're going into the shortest area, look. You see all the autumn. Autumn, look. My car is over there, see my van? And my c -- my wire and my car, the silver and the white one, I've got my car there. Now look the sky has kind of not got anything in it, no chem. trails, no nothing. It's quite nice and pleasant out there and there's a breeze. Oh. A nice freight train going by, so thanks. Let's see what they're going out of, a Redland Aggregates. 
They're not making as much money. That train was half the size they usually are. Oh another one --
I feel like a trains bar. Do I look like one? Sorry, did you say yes? 
Don't look at me like that. 
Look, YouTube, I've got a bed now, a double bed look, wow. Look, yeah, I got a new double bed today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, um. What else. There's not really much going on. Actually I wasn't -- I dunno. Anyone remember the New World game cards, um, that were quite sort of -- if you looked at them you'd think oh, 'cause they're quite similar to some events that have occurred. Um, but there was one that said pandemics, economical collapse, civil unrest, natural disasters, oh there's been another earthquake in Indonesia today. That would be the what, third? 
More than that. 
More. 
There's been more than that . 
There must have been four or five earthquakes in the last four or five weeks. What. You what? You know what I mean. Six point and seven point and eight, what. . . they're not small earthquakes. Uh, I don't know. You know maybe back to report something over the weekend, I'll let you know what the tornado is like that was approaching us that no one seems -- it looks like a tornado. You know obviously it isn't. Well. It's a slim possibility. Government focuses growth by the end of the year. At what, growth from what? Service sector behind unexpected economy. . . 
Only economy thing is gonna rise by the end of the. . . 
Yeah because of Christmas. There'll be a surge of people who buy things which will put the GDP up, of course it will. Everyone spends at least a fucking thousand pound at Christmas. So, you know, do the maths, sixty six million people spending a thousand pound each, quite a lot of money. There's gonna be a peak. 
And then it's gonna go swoosh as everyone can't pay back their credit. Then by March oh dear, are we fucked? So yeah, um, yeah, quite interesting then over in England, it's a bit sort of em, yeah. Anyways sort of like I'm gonna go now 'cause I think ten minutes and I've blogged about absolutely nothing. I think. But then I'm just not here . I gotta go back to work on Monday, they're on strike today but yeah. At least I'm not suffering having next week off. I'm a postal worker, I work indoors, um, doing special deliveries and apparently we're striking next Saturday so that's great. It's ten hour shift, though, that I don't have to do. Means I only get paid for thirty hours but I've got the money, I can survive. 'Cause I live to my millions. Okay, thank you, good night. Peace, love and light, say goodbye
Goodbye
Hold on. Waves, will you wave?
