British insurance company Willis Group holdings recently leased one hundred thousand square feet of my city's icon, the Sears tower. As part of this deal, the tower is being renamed, Willis Tower. The renaming of the Sears tower already has a lot of Chicagoans protesting saying, what you talking 'bout? No, really they are actually saying that; search YouTube. But here in Chicago we protest lots of important things. 
In the past, say eighteen eighty six, we protested thing like unfair labor practices in order to bring about progress. And as time went buy we started protesting things to preserve our history. Like when Chicagoans protested the renaming of a department store in two thousand and six and again in two thousand and seven and again in two thousand and eight. Speaking of history, historically some of our protests lead to the eight hour work day and the abolishment of child labor. No wonder there is so much unemployment; no kids working. Now all too often our protests seem to lead nowhere. History is important but without change it's not really history. 
And in this case I like to think of that historical quote. I think it was Shakespeare that said what's in a name, that which we call a rose by any other name is still a big ass building named after a corporation or something like that. Besides, it could have been worse. Hi I'm Martin Blow with Blow management. I'd like to buy some skyscrapers.
