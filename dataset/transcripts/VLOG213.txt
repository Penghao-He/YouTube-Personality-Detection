Zero rushing touch downs this entire season so far. Zero rushing touchdowns. Zero point zero. Pretty simple but interesting question was asked to both Terrell Owens and to Trent Edwards. 
The question was, if you were a fan today in the stands, would you too have been booing the team? Terrell Owens' response: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I would. They deserve better. And I agree with him there. Um, I wasn't in the stands yesterday, but I was a fan booing. 
When asked the same question in the post game press conference to Trent Edwards. Here's his answer: I'm not a Bills fan; I'm a football player here, so I can't really answer that question. Well, well, fans out there, I think we just found part of the problem. 
Our quarterback's not a fan of the team, apparently not on any level, because if he was, on any level, he would have answered like Terrell Owens, who said, you know what? Yeah, I would have booed because that was just a total disgrace, the sloppiest, crappiest football I've ever seen. But no; his answer: I'm, I'm not a fan, I'm a player here. Maybe that's why, you know, there's a little bit of lack of passion, you know? 
Um, let's talk about the penalties. Thirteen accepted penalties. There was actually much more called. I'm pretty sure they got to like sixteen, maybe seventeen penalties called. Thirteen penalties accepted, and of those thirteen, nine of them were false starts. What? Nine false starts. 
Roscoe Parrish's fumble. Sort of remind you of anything? Maybe uh, game one of the season, Monday night against the Patriots? Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Don't tou -- what? He touched it. Oh my God, the Browns got the ball. Lee Evans, in a post game interview, said to a reporter in the locker room, quote: I can't stand it. I can't stand to see it get much worse. 
Well, uh, nice statement, Lee, 'cause neither can any of us fans. Would -- I can't possibly think that this could get much worse, but guess what? We have to go to the Meadowlands next week and play the Jets. Okay. Dick Jauron has lost every single divisional game for the Bills since December ninth of two thousand and seven, and the Bills are zero and eight since then, losing every single AFC East game they've played last year and two of them this year. 
Since Dick Jauron signed his contract extension, Dick Jauron with the Bills is three in twelve since that contract extension and one in seven at home. I have a hard time believing that anyone on this team is still fully behind Dick Jauron. 
And you know, if the players aren't behind the coach, you end up with a game like this past Sunday.
