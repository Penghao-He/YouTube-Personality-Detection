Oh my, it's XXXX. Ho ho ho! 
XXXX Video VLOG.
Hello, everybody, welcome to a new edition -- a special holiday edition of the cyber front porch, you back on the front porch with me. My name is XXXX. Yes, listen to my voice, you have to deal with it. Um, I've been battling bronchitis and a touch of pneumonia and all kinds of crap. For the last, like, two weeks, I've been sick. Now I feel good enough to actually make a video so that's what I'm doing because I had something I wanted to talk about. 
What I want to talk about is the Christmas Card Swap Shoppe. Over in the side bar over yonder, doot doot, you'll find an address to send me a Christmas card. If you send me a Christmas card, I'll send you a Christmas card back. In this Christmas card you will find a very special recipe of my grandmother's. Just like I did last year I'm sending out another special recipe and I plan on doing this every year. So if you wanna wanna share in the recipe, you've gotta send a card. 
If you don't want to send a card, just send me an email, private message me, or email right here billyctv at gmail dot com, and I will send you a copy of the recipe to you with a little typed Happy Holidays from me to you. So you don't have to waste a stamp on little old me. It's up to you, whatever you want to do. But I prefer a card because you see this wall behind me? I'm gonna put all the cards back there as I get them. I've already got a couple. Um, Alleycat nine eight five six and cabbalaca both have sent me cards, and I've got some more I'm sure over in the PO Box, but I just haven't been there yet because I ain't been feeling good. 
Anyhow, how's everybody doing? You doing your Christmas shopping? Everything okay? Everybody feeling sporty? Holiday? Well, I'm getting into the holiday spirit. I've got to, uh, start making a few more videos now that I can talk and I'll break out my Santa Claus hat and I'll try to share in fellowship and share the holidays with you. As any and most of you know who followed me for any amount of time, you understand that Christmas is one of my favorite times of the year. Absolutely positively a great time of the year for me. Not only a good time of year but I gain a few pounds. Ho ho ho ho ho ho! That's my inner Claus. Ha ha ha! 
Anyhow, well anyhow. Oooh. I don't know what to say. I've been missing. I haven't made any videos in a while, I'm sorry. I kinda feel like I'm letting those folks down that watch me. But it's the holidays and I'm gonna try to make it up to you. Also, if you've been following my blog, my website, www dot XXXX dot com, uh, you'll see that I've been posting holiday recipes and stuff over there so go check it out, go check it out. 
What else is going on? Um, nothing. I'm going to do more videos soon, so keep watching. Uh, again, don't forget the Christmas Card Swap Shoppe, I would love to share Christmas cards with you. You know, a lot of you live far, far away and it's a way for me to share my Christmas spirit with you. You know, and sure we can get over here and make videos and we can send emails, but there's nothing like getting a card with a very special gift from me to you, uh, that used to belong to my grandmother. So there you go. How about that? 
Happy Holidays, everybody. Merry Christmas. What is it? It's fifteen days Christmas, fourteen days Christmas eve, and two days 'til my birthday. Whoo, I'm gonna be forty five. Oh my God. You all be well, you be blessed. Remember, a smiling face makes the world a better place. Happy Holidays. And you know, do me a favor - if you can spare anything, give something to someone the holiday season, especially those that don't have anything. Thank you much, talk to you soon. Tata for now, ho ho ho!
