Hi XXXX, it's XXXX, and this is just a quick little update to let you know how I'm doing. Um, I went to a retreat with the church, um, last weekend and, um, when I got up there, I couldn't eat anything. Um, my -- I don't know if it was like the altitude or like what, but my band got really tight and I couldn't eat anything. When I came back, um, my weight was down to on seventy seven. Um, and then after a couple of days of being home, then my weight started to get back to normal but I still couldn't eat so I had to go back to see my surgeon and get a little bit of food out of my band and they took out one cc, putting me at four point two. 
Everybody, this is XXXX. Um, I'm on my retreat right now. I got here last night. It was -- it was dark when I got here, so, uh, I came last year but, um, this year I came with the intentions of running in the mornings. Well, last night I was all pumped, looking to get up early this morning and run, so I get up early, earlier than I'd like to at least, um, start running. Before I know it, I'm going downhill and suddenly I'm going uphill. It's cold and, uh, my Central Valley California self is evasive. So, I wanted to do a video, and I wanted to run. Came back out of here to the little trail they out here in the neighborhood. You can see me and just like the other part that I was running on, it's all uphill and downhill and it's raining. It's muddy and it's wet. And I'm not exactly sure where I'm at. But I'm looking to stop walking at least. I don't think I'm going to get any more running done. Now, I brought my jump rope with me. If I had any brains in my head, I would go back and jump rope for however long 'til I decided to pass out. But now I'm half way through this little adventure of mine. It feels like I'm going to die. I was thinking, this is going to be a breeze 'cause I went to the gym only. I've been running a mile, you know, and I've been doing it under ten minutes, I feel like I'm gonna die now seriously. Breather, really quick. When I get to the top, because standing at an angle is no fun. I said the top and the more steps I take, the more higher it gets. Geez. So, my sister's going to see this video posting and she's going to laugh at me. I'm really -- I've got to stop. If, uh, I don't know if you can see down there. I'm pretty high, I mean, way down there is the cars. I don't know if you could see them or not. Ooh, let's not fall off the side though. Okay, my cousin got up with me. She said, "Let's go down to the showers and take showers and get ready for our day today. " I want to run before I take a shower and she's just like, "What? " She's like, "Well, I got flip flops on so I'm not running with you. " I swear I saw sneakers in her bag though. Rachel. I feel like I'm gonna die. Looks like I'm almost there guys. Looks like I'm almost there. I have not breathed so hard in forever. This uphill stuff is just not my thing. Course I didn't think it was uphill when I started. Looks like it's going down guys. I've been walking, the video says four minutes and fifty one seconds. But I turned it on half way through. I'm starting to make my way downhill. Over there must have been the cabins. And then -- okay. Not sure what that is. Don't look like a kitchen. Maybe these are the cabins. Maybe I found my way back to the cabins. Should I share my music? Right, this song's forty minutes long. Let's see, where's my cabin? I should go wake everybody up. I don't think this is my cabin though. I think I'm lost. I'll do another later. I think I'm lost right now in the woods, in the rain and it's wet. Oh, this is kind of weird. I'm like I have to get in so I guess I'm going around, again. Okay, well it was nice seeing you guys and I'll have to splice this video later. All right, bye.
