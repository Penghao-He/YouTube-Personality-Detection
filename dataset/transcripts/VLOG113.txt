Hello. Okay. This is just going to be real quick, get to the point, um. First off, I'm going to have a contest, um, soon. Probably within the next two weeks I'll have the official, you know, contest video rules and whatnot up. 
Um, I've got some really good prizes. I kind of need some time to get, um, all that around, but I've got a few things so far from Mack and, um, just some hair bands, stuff like rolls. Anyway, contest, um, but it you want to enter the contest obviously, golden rule for all, YouTube contest is to subscribe, so if you'd like to do that now go ahead. 
Um, promise the prizes will be grand. Also, um, I'm getting to request that you guys send me, I'm really bad about it, but um, if you want to request something, just write it here in this video, in the comments and I promise I'll read it and I'll try to get to it. 
There's also a list over on the side, probably on this side, um, of my, you know, home page type deal that, uh, talks about some of the videos that I've started -- yeah, started, not finished. 
But, um, also for the contest, it's, ah, gonna be somewhat related to uh, the tutorials I'm putting up over the next week, so look out for those. 
Uh, it's -- it's going to be a little different than most contests that I've seen anyway, but I want to give people fair chance and there's going to be three prize groups. Well, actually one grand prize winner and the second two prize winners will be the same 'cause everyone took it. You know, all the nice presents stuff. 
Um, I got more highlights to my hair. It's a lot lighter. It looks a lot better, this video is really dark and it really sucks, but my webcam is broken, so that's going to put a little damper in my parade for this. 
But, um, I've actually been getting some donations and what not from a fashion blog that I have and I'm gonna kind of use that money for the contest instead of the blog, but, you know, same difference. 
 But, anyway. Um, there's going to be, like, I think three tutorials I'll have up that are gonna kind of, you know, relate to the contest and whatnot, but, uh, more information on that when I know exactly what's going on and I'm really want to get the prizes around so I can show you guys what I have for you because I'm really excited to like give this stuff away 'cause it makes me, I don't know, happy. 
But anyway, thank you for watching and thank you for everyone who subscribed to me, um, recently. I can't believe I have, like, you know, almost seven hundred subscribers. 
That's just nuts, madness, but thanks much.
