Hi. So I don't know if it's the moron in me, but I have a tendency to repeat things I hear other people say even if I don't know what it means. 
Is that what you wanted? 
Yeah. That's because -- you know -- we haven't had any broken promises since nineteen eighty eight. 
Can you b --
I believe our government. I mean it's not like we haven't had a broken promise since nineteen eighty eight. 
What happened in nineteen eighty eight? 
Stuff. Bad stuff. 
What sort of -- was it bad stuff? 
It was bad stuff. And you know what works well with jokes too? Do what he says and then she said, yeah -- well maybe you should have thought it out before you stuck it in. He said. Then she said, well maybe you should have thought it out before you stuck it in.

It was lovely to meet you. Thank you so much for sending in your photos. Sorry when I said I those guys I meant, I met them. It's just so much more fun with the sense of beep you know, so much fun. 
Yeah. So I'll -- I'll have a new video up in three days. I will see you guys then. Until then however, have a wonderful weekend. Be safe. Be well. Eat fruit and remember, if a stranger offers you candy, follow him because he probably knows where there's a shitload more.

Yeah, sometimes I open up with a question to cover up for that and Ellen ex lemon dude , I hate the question rot things. Sometimes I just type random things in there and say, oops, sorry, wrong box.
