I'm here to talk about a very special organization, called the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. This is especially important to me for one important reason -- I have Ulcerative Colitis, and I'm gonna talk to you about it. This is me. This is XXXX of the XXXX. XXXX and I have one thing in common, we both have Ulcerative Colitis. Hank and I are completely different people. We live in different states, we're different ages, and we live completely different lives. But we do have one thing in common -- we both have Ulcerative colitis. I've had it since I was fourteen. Hank's had it since he was twenty three. Ulcerative Colitis is not a fun disease - there is very little you can do about it, except for medicate. Lots of medication. Pills, pills, pills, pills, tic taks. 
So the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, or the CCFA, works to help aid research into finding a cure for Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. As of right now the only real solution to Crohn's or Colitis is something called an ileectomy. An ileectomy's a procedure where they take out the diseased part of the colon. The only problem with that is it's not always successful. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad procedure. I have a friend who had Crohn's disease, then he had an ileectomy, and now lives a completely normal life. In fact, he's getting married tonight. The problem is the people who it doesn't work for. Sometimes they never get back to normal and their bodies are completely different for the rest of their lives, and it's pretty bad. So let's get back on topic, the CCFA - I'm supporting it because it's important to me. 
This is a foundation that can make a massive difference for millions and millions of people around the world who have - live with daily pain from Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, like Hank and I. Okay, now if you have no I - every year for the past three, thousands and thousands of people have been making Project for Awesome videos. A Project for Awesome video is a video where you choose a charity, and you make a video supporting it. Then you go and you find other Project for Awesome videos. You rate it, you comment it, and you favorite it until you - your fingers fall off. Hopefully by doing this we can trick YouTube's algorithm, so the main pages are just Project for Awesome videos. At the end of the Project for Awesome, the top promoted charities get tons and tons of money donated to them. 
So in the end, for one day YouTube's not about cats jumping in and out of boxes, or about Kanye being a jerk - it's about raising money for charity and making the world suck a little less. So rate, comment, and favorite this video and other Project for Awesome videos, and try to make a difference. By the way, Hank's on my wall. 
I have a complicated relationship with the distal portion of my large intestine, also known as the colon. I started feeling kinda shitty when I turned twenty three and then the pain got worse and worse every day, and the days turned into weeks. I finally went to see the doctor and I pooped into a cup, and then a few weeks after that he stuck this camera up my butt, and the camera was in a tube, and the tube it pumped out air, so that my colon would inflate and they could look around in there. When I woke up the doctor was looking at my chart. I called his attention to me with a fifteen minute fart, and he said "Son I hate to tell you, cause I know you're not gonna like this, but they got a name for what you have and it's called Ulcerative colitis. And in those seven syllables, there's a mess of shitty news -- it's likely that you've had your last healthy feeling poos. 
It's like road rash on your colon, you'll bleed -- it'll hurt, and no one knows what causes it and there is no cure. And yeah, your chances of cancer have gone up a bit, but colon cancer's curable if you keep your eye on it. But what's mostly what will piss you off is how much you're gonna pay -- I know you're not insured and you'll probably stay that way. See insurance companies hate to deal with sick folks like you. They don't like taking money from folks they might have to give it back to. And your pills are gonna cost you both your arms and at least one leg - I suggest you go to Canada, get on your knees, and beg. Because here the costs are as high as the market conveyer. Take a barrel and compare it with soiled underwear. I sat there on that bed and thought about how I used to like to pooh, I thought that maybe there was a mistake, how could this be true? 
I asked the doctor, pleading, begging if he was sure, and if he was, how could it be that there was no cure. The only cure we have, he said, is to take the whole thing out, and then to get your movements out we install a little spout. I told him that I'd rather take a thousand thousand dollar pills. He agreed and sent me home with similar sounding bills, and now really all I've learned, besides the importance of fiber, is the health care system's more screwed up than a fifty year old Fred subscriber.
