Hey friends, it's XXXX and I am doing an update. Um. I am feeling so much better than I was feeling on Monday on my last video, um. I remember, or if you remember if you watched it -- I was whining that I've been losing and gaining the same five pounds for over three months now. And you know, I'm a hundred and sixty pounds, a hundred fifty nine this morning. Um. Whatever, okay, just whatever. 
So um, let me tell you why I'm feeling better. When I was doing the Couch to Five pay program, I was like so excited about running because like -- you should start with sixty second sprints at week one and I was like, oh my God I can't run sixty seconds, I can't run, oh I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I can't even run down the driveway. Anyway and so when I would run sixty seconds and I made it through the whole week being able to do that, at that very last run when it was over it was like, oh my God, oh my God, I am finished. I had graduated week one, I'm on to week two, and then all during the weekend before I started week two I was thinking, oh my gosh, it's ninety second sprint. How am I gonna do that, I thought I was gonna die at sixty seconds. Even though I did it, I thought I was gonna die. And so then when did the ninety seconds I was like, Oh! I did it, I did it, I did it you know, and I was just so excited. And this happened week to week to week to week, and you, and then I finally made it through to week nine and was able to run for a full thirty minutes at a time. 
And then I did my races, um, and was able to fun a full five K without stopping which was like, the biggest high ever. And you know, the whole time that I was doing it, doing my training, I never did think about okay, I wonder how many calories this is burning, and oh my -- I did think a lot that it sucked because it's exercise. But the whole time I was also thinking, I can't believe I'm doing this, I can't believe my body is capable of doing this and the whole time that I was doing it my body was changing and don't get me wrong, I know that I wasn't a year out then, and you know I was losing weight quicker which really wasn't that quick for me if you remember. But maybe two pounds a week was really, really good. 
But anyway, it was something I was excited about, and it wasn't always about the scale because I was doing something else that was bigger, something that was like more meaningful than watching the scale move. And since then, I've been exercising for the benefit of exercise and trying to make it that scale goes down, you know what I mean? And I've been focusing on the scale again and it's just not -- it's not fulfilling, it's frustrating because the scale's not moving. I'm over a year out, you know it's kind of hard. 
And so um, you know I was thinking, I want that passion, I want that goal to, you know, to keep getting better and better and better and seeing progress, and not talking losing sadness or watching the scale, I'm talking about my body being able to do something that it never could do before because I was obese. So anyway, I found, well I decided, remember last year I was like oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I ran the gate river run five K that is. It wasn't even the gate river run but it was on the day of the gate river run and its where the gate river run started, it was a public quarter time junior and something run for charity or something like that. But anyway the gate river run is a fifteen K and I said last year I'm doing that one next year which will be in March of two thousand and ten. And you know, I am. I am able to run. Now I can't run fifteen K but there are I mean like, Jamie and Tom, there are people that are out there who used to be obese who are training for marathons and have marathons and you know what, I am going to train also. I found a website, I'm gonna put it over in this way, in the side. It has all kinds of different programs to get you training for a race. Um. Even walking. And it has different levels too, so if you are just like wanting to train for a five K and you already can run a five k and you want to increase speed, it's got training for that. 
It's got all these different programs that you can do, it's got beginners or novice, intermediate and advanced. And it's got walking, jogging and running so if you can't run, what's stopping you from being able to train for walking a five K? I mean if you're only post op, that's what you should be doing. I mean a five K is three point one miles, so that may sound like it's you know, never gonna happen at this point. But you know you start with a quarter of a mile. And then you know you work up next week to do maybe half a mile. And you keep going until you're able to walk the entire five K. And the two races that I've been in they, the back people, all walked it, so there's no reason why you can't make that a goal for yourself to be able to walk in a race, and then maybe the next race you might run a little bit or jog, or whatever. 
And you know, it's very, very motivating and another thing that motivated me was actually going and registering for these races because I thought okay, I've already paid for it. It's usually about twenty bucks. I've already paid for it so now I've really gotta train because I won't be able to do it once it comes. So anyway, I was excited very much so, about that. I have decided to start training for -- I don't know if I wanna start training for the half marathon or the eight K or the fifteen K, it doesn't matter though. The fifteen K isn't until March. I wanna be well able to do it by then because I'm not gonna start -- I enjoy running. Um. And I'm in Florida. I don't want running on the treadmill, it's too monotonous and after like three minutes I think oh my God, I'm not done yet, oh besides I hate it, I'm so bored. But when I'm out in the neighborhood or on the streets or whatever you know I've got a matmorrun. com and I you know, map where I'm going, it tells me how far it is and when I take off, and you know it's motivating to be able to see scenery and feel the wind blow and the cars go buy, and listen to those kinds of things and you know I have my iPod too and -- plus I make the kids come with me on their bicycles behind me so that one could carry my water and they can go, "Go mum, go" and you know, "You're doing great", and all that stuff. So anyway we're gonna look at the time. 
Okay. I've only got a couple of minutes. I did go my one year post op this week. And my doctor was just amazed, he was like, oh, most people don't do as good as you did, XXXX, and you know, that's just awesome. I didn't go and tell him that I have the YouTube support system and that I exercise more than the average patient, because a lot of people really do believe that you can just um, you know let their surgery do all the work and it can. And I'm not gonna be that way, I could tell I wanted to change my life, I wanted to get active, and so anyway I did tell him that I did two five K races and that you know, I work hard but didn't go into detail that I am strength training, that I go to the gym, and that I'm you know exercising all the time. So anyway, that goes to show you guys if you incorporate exercise, you're gonna do better than the average do, I think it's sixty to eighty percent um weight loss, excess weight that is, and I've lost like eighty five so far and I'm still not done. I asked him what my goal should be, I'm one sixty now, and he said that one forty. And that's what I wanted to be, remember guys? So I've got twenty pounds to go but I'm not gonna focus on that. I'm going to focus on training, and that will change my body. Um. And then what else am I gonna say. Oh, he said I have about five more months that I will slowly lose and you know, when I was busting my butt and everything I was only losing about four pounds a month anyway, so I'm not expecting to lose anything really, but if I do, that's great. I love my body, I love being a Five A, you know the number on the scale is very frustrating and annoying but honestly the whole thing is the number that's frustrating me. The number. Because I'm happy with the way I look. 
It's the number that irritates me, why? I don't know. Because if I look this way and it was a hundred forty pounds I would be thrilled, it's that freaking number that's got me obsessed. So screw the number, I'm gonna run and I hope you guys will start doing it with me. I'm gonna put a link over on the five of -- for the gate river run, it's the biggest fifteen K in the United States and it's for like the fifteen K championship and I would love for us to be able to run it together. Jamie come on, won't you come and run it with me? Anyway, gotta talk to you later, bye.
