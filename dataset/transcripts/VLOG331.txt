Ladies and gentlemen, how're you all doing? My name is XXXX and I look for opportunities. 
Um, you know uh, just a lot of stuff's been going on which is why I haven't really posted a video in a while. Um, just a lotta -- a lotta -- a lotta family stuff and friends and whatnot. Anyways, um, you know, it's bad stuff, but, you know, you gotta move on from it. So that's what I'm doing. 
Um, it's -- some of you guys -- I don't know. Just so you guys know, I'm a hundred seventy two pounds now. Um, but that's probably because of the stress so not necessarily a good, uh, eating habit. 
Um, I've been working out a lot more. Every morning I do about uh, thirty to fifty pushups uh, just to get my day going. And then I try to do a little workout throughout the day. Um, so, you know, just -- that's just a little update for you guys. I'm sorry I didn't really, you know, uh, go with the daily blogs all the time. But um, I'm just letting you guys know, a hundred seventy two pounds. I'm working out pretty much every day now and um, you know, it's pretty good. 
Um, and yesterday I uh, was helping my friend and his brother film something for his girlfriend. Um, it's like a micro Christmas thing. And I am going -- I might put that on this channel. It's not like I have any other channel to put it on, but I might put it on here. Kind of -- I think -- you know, I was filming it and stuff like that and I felt a little direct and it was -- it was a lot of fun. So uh, hopefully you guys will see that pretty soon. 
Um, anyway, I have a lot more raps that I would love to get out and a lot more songs that I'd love to get out. So um, that's kind a what this channel's turning into. A lot of rap and songs and blogs. 
Um, I used my skip, but I just don't have time to skipping right now. Um, but anyway um, you know, that's enough out of me. 
So thanks for watching and stay healthy and I hope you have a happy holiday if I don't talk to you before and -- yeah -- that's it. 
You guys have a good one.
