Hi, everyone. My brain is gone; I just want to throw that out there first, because, oh my gosh, I'm so tired. I've been really bad on my diet too, oh my gosh, eating everything in the world, um, but I was up yesterday at four AM to be at work by six and then I was up at three this morning to be at work by five. I'm very tired. It's only eight thirty right now, in the evening and I'm ready to fall asleep. 
Anyway, um, let's get on with this. Um, Josh, thanks for the shout out that makes me so happy, like makes my day, when I get a shout out. Em, you're about the only one I talk to out here, so yay. How do you, like, get more into the screen than me? Am I just like that big or is it my camera, or is it the layout? I need to stop watching myself. Okay, anyway, um, I've been doing a lot of nothing. Going to school, back in school, taking a -- excuse me, my nose is congested. I'm taking interpreting -- no, I'm not, I lied. I'm taking sign language one and English one hundred, 'cause I'm lame and I can't write an essay to save my life so, I'm working on that. Um, and those are the only two classes and I work five days a week, I go to school two days a week and I have no days off, it's really fun. Thursday's in the afternoon. Um, I've been talking to Josh a lot online which is pretty awesome. I still have the package I was supposed to send you guys, ah, in my closet; I'm looking at it right there, so, um, come out to California, 'cause I have no money and I can't send it, so and 'cause it's -- yeah, it was themed, but the theme can't go on, but the show must go on. 
Uh, I was just sitting here watching my cat play with this, like, you know, plastic, like, tag things that are on your clothes that keep the tags on, she's playing with that and it's really adorable, that's not interesting at all. 
Dating life is going somewhat okay. I feel like I'm breathing all over the mike, I'm sorry if I am. Um, I haven't met -- well I've met one guy and he's really cool, but really flaky. Every time we try to hang out something happens and we can't, so I'm over it. Nice guy, though. And then there's this other guy who lives in Oceanside and I hope he doesn't watch these videos, 'cause I'm just going to talk about him, but basically, he, uh, is really awesome. I don't know if he's what I want in a boyfriend, but very cool guy. Makes me feel good. Um, he says I'm gorgeous; don't think I can trust that. And Josh ran away near Brittany Spears, Jesus Pirate pumpkin, Steve Tyler freaking awesome, better than any pumpkin I can do. I love carving pumpkins, but I don't, um, I don't know. My hair, my goodness, this is terrible, that's cute, so bad whatever, it's just YouTube. Oh, I'm so tired. 
Um, what else? I have a lot of things I need to do. I've got tons of time to do them, but I've been procrastinating everything, it's really, really bad. Really bad. 
Um, I like my fan, it's pretty cool, you can see it, maybe put decorations on it or something. That's a good idea, I'll put like, a different image on the fan, 'cause I'm really good at editing and I'll -- and edit an image onto the fan. It'll be taped. Why can't I edit videos? Josh come to California and teach me how to edit -- edit videos. Just annoying whining. 
Um, I feel like there's so much more we need to talk about. Josh, you are green, honey, and look -- look what I have it's honey and it's green. there it is. Ooo, this one's got a zipper, so it can be all cozy inside, see? Grrrr. That's just how I'm going to do all my videos from now on, 'cause I am the green hoodie guild knight of the round -- of the square desk, of the laptop. Don't ask me why. This is also why I don't drink, because I don't need alcohol to go insane. 
 Oh my god, I'm so tired. Um, there was a lot more, I don't remember what I was going to talk about, just want some guy who lives very far away, but ah, no, I won't. embarrass Josh, but there's a certain guy that I want, that I mentioned before, that needs to come to California and marry me, okay? Not going to say who it is, because I don't want him to think I'm insane. 'Cause I got featured on this video. Okay, that's enough. I don't know. Okay, I guess I will talk to everyone later, um, I think I've rambled long enough. I hope it's not too long and I will talk to you. Seven minutes, oh my, I'm so sorry. Okay. Bye. Sorry.
