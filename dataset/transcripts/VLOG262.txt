So, this is a quick blog to test out the new auto captions feature. A warning to you all is that it is going to suck a bit because there will be no background noise and I am reading this as a transcript that I can upload later on and see how accurately Google can time code tags to make this text file into a captions file. 
I am interested in finding out how well it matches the text to what I'm saying. I want to see if it works for accents that aren't American and how it splits up the text. Of course, I also have some questions for the good folk at YouTube. 
First up, when will machine captioning become available to more users? As someone who uses captions a lot, I would love to get my hands on this feature and I think I can offer some good feedback. So perhaps YouTube could consider users like myself, if they are going to roll it out, for channels. 
The second thing is, of course, when will these be made available in other languages? Obviously if this feature were to become available in Japanese, that would be a huge help to all the Japanese language students out there. There are several videos explaining this feature here, right here and here. The long one is a bit of a chore, but the explanations seems to indicate that the main audience that they're thinking of is the hearing impaired. 
This might be followed by more people perhaps interested in translated captions, which is more my area of interest. My more precise area of focus is even more specialized than this. It is making captions for students of language, which is why I make all my captions bilingual. This means I have other features that I want to see, like the ability for people to download caption files to read and study, and the ability to collaboratively make and upload captions to other people's channels. For now, I just want to see how this works, so make sure your captions are turned on below, and see what you think of the syncing. Peace.
