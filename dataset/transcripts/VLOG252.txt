Hey, YouTube. Um, right, okay. Just a quick video, really, just to sorta say sorry . Um, you'll see why. Because this is a pre hiatus video. Um, at least I'm informing you. It can't be helped, because I'm going to university tomorrow, and I won't really be able to make videos for a little while; I'm not sure how long. 
Um, two reasons for this, really. First, is I don't -- I won't have a camera when I get to university, not a big one, um, because I'm using the family camera at the moment. And obviously I can't take that with me because it's the family's, not mine. Um, but I'm going to buy a camera. I can probably do better than this, one to be fair, so . 
Uh, secondly is internet. I'm not sure when or, well -- or whether I will have it, um, because I haven't got my laptop. I'm using a home for internet now, but my laptop is the one I'll be having at uni and I don't know whether the internet is going to work on it 'cause it's a bit iffy. Hopefully, it will work, there's a slight chance it won't. And I'm also -- I'm not sure how quickly they gonna give me internet at uni as well. 
Sorry. That's the reasons. Sorry. Don't unsubscribe; I will be back and I'll be awesome in a new location. Um, so you know, don't unsubscribe. Uh, I love you -- all of you -- so much. Um, but so just wait. Ah, yeah. Oh, so, bye.
