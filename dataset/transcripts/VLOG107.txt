All right. So, I'm a total liar and I don't blame you if you unsubscribe, but, huh, if you're not going to keep watching my videos for me, at least keep watching them for him. What do you think about that song? 
I've been here for thirty something years looking at myself in the same dirty mirror. 
Isn't it always kind of weird when you get, like, randomly called by someone? And then they leave a voice mail. I'm kinda scared to hear it, 'cause that was somebody I met at a coffee shop, like, a month ago and I got their number and they are just, like, calling me and it's really weird 'cause it's, like, three in the afternoon. 
Who calls someone they met -- met at a coffee shop at three in the afternoon, like, a month after they met you? I don't know, maybe I'm just being weird. I don't think -- I think they're really cool; it's just kind of strange like. 
I bet it's, like, one of those calls, like, "Hi, I found this number in my phone and I was wondering who it is? This is Jamie, you met me at a coffee shop, remember, I'm really awesome. " We'll see, we'll listen to the message. Maybe I'll listen to it and then I'll let you listen to it, but probably not. 
So, my tattoo. Yes, I still have it. Imagine that. All right, so I think in my last video I said it was a milk thistle. Um, I said that it was a Scottish flower, but actually, it doesn't grow in Scotland, it grows in Middle Eastern regions. Um, just to clear that up, but people of Scottish heritage do get it as a -- as a tattoo. 
Um, it's usually more of a stylized version -- it looks more like a symbol rather than the actual plant. Um, whereas I went for a more detailed look, but anyways, now down to spiritual meaning. 
So the milk thistle plant has been regarded for centuries and centuries as a very highly powerful medicine, um, in terms of, um, it has been used for detoxification of the liver and also it's known for its anti cancer effects, which are two pretty awesome things. Um, you can actually buy milk thistle extract at Wild Oats. 
Silence . 
And the reason why those two attributes of the plant really spoke to me and I thought it be a good thing to perm -- permanently adorn my body with is because one, alcohol -- alcoholism is something that really affects my family. Um, my aunt is in her sixties and right now, she's suffering majorly from the long terms effects -- long term effects of alcohol. 
Um, I personally have had issues with alcohol. I started drinking when I was 12. Um, I -- I was kind of a crazy kid for a while and -- so I wanted to put this thing permanently on my body, um, have it be the thorn on my -- the thorn in my side. God, I can't talk today. The thorn in my side to constantly remind me never to put my body in jeopardy for mental comfort. 
Because I'm a firm believer that anything that's going to put your physical health in jeopardy, isn't going to bring you mental comfort in the long run. Um, I think that mind, body and soul, spirit, they will -- they should be able to be happy all in the same context and in harmony with each other and so you need to keep finding that perfect balance between mental happiness and physical happiness before you are going to be truly happy. 
So, I have a thorn in my side to always remind me of that. Um, and I don't mean not to drink, I do enjoy, you know, well actually I don't 'cause I'm only twenty, so it's illegal. 
Anyways, and then the anti cancer effects, um, that's pertaining to my grandmother. She is a breast cancer survivor. She had her right breast removed and so my tattoo's on my right side. 
Pretty simple, um, but definitely a deep meaning and I'm guessing you want to see it again because the last video I did was pretty shitty, it was pretty dark and I was all giddy and I just wanted to really quickly show it to you. And it probably looks something like a demented elephant head. 
I'm not sure, but, uh. I actually made some footage a couple days after I got it, 'cause right now it's peeling or else I'd, like totally show you. But, um, I made some footage like three days after I made that first video, 'cause I was going to post a video like I promised, but I didn't get around to finishing it, so I'll just show you that 'cause that shows it pretty well and it's not peeling and it looks cool. 
So here goes.
