Oh my God. It's actually been forever since I've sat down here. And lot. It's been too long. I'm sorry guys. 
I suppose you need an -- better explanation to why I stopped doing the daily blogs, yeah? Well, basically I'm starting college next week some time. And I just won't have time to make these every day anymore. And, like, I started these in the summer so I had a lot of free time, but just things keep getting on top of me and I keep falling really behind with these. And I think it might've been silly of me to the daily thing 'cause I just know I don't have time. 
That's why I decided to make them weekly more or less. Or, you know, just when I can. So, like, so you might see two or three a week, but not one every day. So won't fall behind at least. So -- yeah. Sorry about that. And I know I'm giving up for whatever, but it's only a daily blog; it's not a big deal, is it? 
But I'm keeping this channel as my blog channel and I still have my other channel which I'm gonna work on 'cause it's been, like, months since I've done anything on it. I uploaded a video there the other day, so link in the sidebar side if you haven't seen it already. 
I'm happy. I went to town today and look what I got. New off the cover Kelly book. And, if you don't know those books, they're brilliant. They're so funny. 
You're also probably wondering, are these, like, gaps in my fringe? No, I've got blond in my fringe now -- got blond in my hair now. Um, basically I got my hair cut a little while ago and -- you know -- I thought when I was coming out -- ah, it's great, it's really short. Cool; won't grow back as fast. But then I got home and I was, like, whoa it's really short! 
And I thought, like, I wanted to get my hair dyed anyhow and I thought my natural hair color was a bit too boring so I wanted to dye it black anyway. But Aneed did this for me -- Aneed, links in the sidebar. Um, I think she did a pretty good damn job, don't you? I like the blond, it's different. And it's sort of Irish; help put colors in it or something. I don't know. Maybe some green or pink or something. Or something. Or I'll just dye it black. I don't know. I'll see -- I'll see how it goes. Yeah. 
How are you guys? It's been forever. I'm a little bit obsessed with this song -- Florence and the Machine -- Dog Days. Probably 'cause I watched so much Skins -- but it's a good song. 
Oh -- also -- I have to tell you guys this. I've started putting stuff up in my room on the walls. Check this out, right? Boom! A single poster. Um, it's just a landscape of New York. But still it's something, right? So I -- I've got another one over here -- hold on. Room's bit of a mess. See it up there above the mirror? Yeah. Also got some stuff going on here. And over here. 'Cause this is my work area so I put stuff up around it. This is my desk and stuff. So I need to get more posters for the walls 'cause as you can see, they are still quite blank and I'm thinking a bit of Audrey Hepburn, a bit more New York, something like that. I don't know. 
So guys, I'll talk to you later but leave me comments and so -- do you like my hair? Also, what type of posters should I put in my room? Hmm? Should I put anything in particular up? Also, how've you guys been? It's been forever, right? I know. So check all the links in the sidebar and all that usual stuff. 
And I should talk to you guys later. Bye.
