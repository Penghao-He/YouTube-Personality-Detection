Hello, YouTube. Um, it is two thirty in the morning, I was up watching a movie, yay, Driving Lessons with Rupert Grint and Julie Walters, it's a good movie. 
Um, I just wanted to say thanks to all of you who left kind comments to my video response, John, and hopefully I'll be making more videos um, got a webcam going now, cause, you know, I wanna see if I'll actually do this before I invest in a decent actual video camera. 
But, other than that, things are quiet in Florida, hot and humid and waiting for Hannah. Uh, yeah, it's . All I'm gonna say tonight is I am tired but I did want to say hi, so hi and good night.
