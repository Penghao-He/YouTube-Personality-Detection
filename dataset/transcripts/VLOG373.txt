Hey, YouTubers, so I just experienced something I thought was pretty scary. I just got back from my classes and I just experienced some of the scariest walks to class and from class. It is icy outside. The streets are slick with ice and so are the sidewalks and I had a class, today, one class, today, one, one class at twelve thirty, so I left my apartment at about eleven fifty. I got over there at about twelve fifteen, that's how long it took me to get from here, my apartment, all the way to the campus and it was scary, because I was trying not to fall down the entire time. There was a couple of times I almost fell, but thankfully I lowered myself to the ground, so I didn't fall too badly. The reason why I don't want to fall again is because I already fell about two weeks ago, I guess now, and I skinned my knee and it hurt and I didn't want to repeat that again, especially with ice because that's really cold. So it was really scary because I was walking and I had slipped and I was sliding and it was really scary and you might think I am being overly dramatic about this, but I'm not. I'm from a place where it normally doesn't get all that icy and here it's really icy. They closed the campus at two o'clock and took a long time just to get back. Got back and I had a message on my phone, it's from work. They are closing the Public Library down at five o'clock due to the weather which is when I would normally go in to work. Thank goodness for that because I don't know how I would have made it to work. I was gonna have to call in and say I could not because there is no way I was going to go anywhere. So I'm guessing the city is closing down. A lot of things looked like they were closing down, everybody is being sent home, campus is shut down. So, yeah, it's pretty scary out there. 
Now why am I telling you this? Because I have nothing else to do. I am pretty much going to be locked up for the rest of the night, and as far as I know, right now, I don't know if I'm going to have classes tomorrow or not. I'm hoping not because it's supposed to be really bad tonight. I'm hoping that tomorrow they'll say no, don't come to class and then the library will still be closed and then I'll be another day stuck inside, here, but that gives me an opportunity to catch up with school work, which I need to do because I haven't done it yet. That's all I really had to say. Just freaking out about the ice and I'm going to go get me some lunch now and eat and then just, I'm here for the rest of the night. So, that's all YouTube.
