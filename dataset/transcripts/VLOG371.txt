No, this is not an illusion. This is me right here in your internet, coming to you on my channel, making a video for the first time since April. 
You know, my summer was busy, but I'm not even going to make excuses. I just didn't make videos for the summer, and that was basically that. But let me just give you, like, a brief little rundown of things that happened during my summer. 
Yes. I went to San Francisco for a week, that was fun. I visited my cousin who works for YouTube. I got to see YouTube Headquarters. They have great food by the way, so go work for YouTube. I had like shrimp scampi and other gourmet items. San Francisco, basically one of the coolest I've ever been to. 
And I got to see Lauren , who now goes to my university where I'm at currently; I'm not at home. And Lauren goes here now, so it's great to see her everyday. That's Viva La Lauren, by the way. 
Though I was planning to take a big road trip to Canada, that did not exactly go through. However, me and two of my friends did take a road trip through the southern United States. We did ten states in five days, and it was amazing. Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana. Yes. That was it. Saw some really cool cities. There's lot's of history and culture and just fun in the South. It's dirty and it's humid and it's vibrant. 
Also, as I'm sure some of you did, I discovered a lot of great music this summer. In no particular order, here's some of the songs I was listening to. 
There was a time, everybody was around and I was testing with you. 
I am so creeped out when it ate, you so cute out when it late, and I got that boom, boom, boom, the future boom, boom, boom. Let me get in that. 
I'm just a ransom prince coming back from my freak out . 
So write for me mama, like, a wagon wheel. Write me, mama, any way you feel. Hey. Mama, write me. 
I've never meant to run away. You know I never want to hurt you. Don't even know . Why does love always feel like, why does love feel, why does love feel, love feel. 
Girl I want to party with you, girl I want to party with you. Girl I just want to take six beers. 
Girl -- It's a brand new goal, slow it down put in the push upside down. . 
Let me exchange you, exchange you because I dance long. People that watch me move and shake it across the dance floor. People that watch me move and shake it across the dance floor. 
So yes, that's pretty much been my summer in trips and working and blah, blah, blah, I don't want to bore you too much with this. But music was one of the great things to happen this summer. Movies, not so much. It's been kind of a crap summer for movies; not gonna lie. 
But I would love to hear from you in the comments. I'm not used to doing this whole comment sidebar thing, but sidebar comments, comments now I want to hear what songs did you listen to this summer. Your summer playlist, if you will. 
I believe that's all for me right now. I hope to be making videos regularly. We'll see how that actually goes, but I'm making videos on XXXX every Thursday with XXXX. I am always tweeting, and I am usually daily boothing as well. Leave me comments there that say, XXXX make more videos, and then maybe I will. 
I missed you guys. If you have video ideas, I'd love those -- I would really love to do something substantial. 
Peace out.
