Hey guys, I'm XXXX . My name is XXXX, if you're hearing this, you have way too much spare time on your hands. Totally Salvation, coming to a cinema near you. Or how about this? Yes, I know I'm not normal, get off my case. Bloody fairies. . 
So basically, pretty pointless, really. Okay, so a quick update, Films are doing their karaoke role take, so we shouted . I heard that Welshford Films is doing Natalie Furtado . So stayed tuned for that. 
Major failure on my part. I got tonsillitis during the exams season. Bad times. Let me go recover and I'm going to leave you in the hands of the worst music video ever made. Here we go.
