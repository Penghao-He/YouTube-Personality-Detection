Hi, everyone. Uh, yeah, I know it's been at least two and a half weeks, maybe three weeks, since I've made a video. Um, I want to make this video, uh, for -- it should help out some of my, um, fellow Feministas, especially, uh, feminists in Canada. Um, I've noticed that, um, when you, uh, speak out very loudly against the patriarchy, um -- whether you're talking about, uh, pornography or domestic violence or the Men's Rights Movement, or the TFL Movement, any -- any of that stuff, when you go up against it, you will sometimes encounter a massive amount of resistance. And that's simple backlash misogyny that most feminists are aware of. 
But, the main reason I want to make this video is because in Canada, you -- you can do something about this. If, um, someone is harassing you, uh, or posting personal information about you, um, threatening you, intimidating you, that is a violation of the Criminal Code of Canada. And I will tell you the steps of what you need to do to, uh, open a file and make sure that, you know, you have a case and you're -- it's open and you're protected. 
The first thing that you need to do is, wherever you live, uh, call the RCMP, or, um, you know, if you're in a city, if you have a city police force you can call them. But, uh, all of the, uh, police forces have, um, an internet, uh, crime division. And, um -- so basically what'll happen is you'll call them, you'll let them know what's happening, and, uh, the constables will come to, uh, where you live and they will, uh, look over, uh, the data. Uh, they will open a file and, um, you will then email them, uh, a lot of stuff. If the threat is, um, particularly, um, bad, uh, you know, they'll -- they'll get to work on it right away. But usually, um, after they come to your place, they will go back to, uh, the office and they will, um, work -- start work on your case right away. 
So, the most important thing that you need to do is you need to document things. And, uh, your constable will, um, uh, give you an email address and, um, phone numbers and things like that, so that if anything escalates, uh, you can just continue to send all the data. Now, when they go back to the office, um, basically, they find out who it is. So, they monitor who these people are, and um -- so there is recourse. Um, you know, I -- I know what's happening to, um, Antique Lens. It happened to me. And so, you know, um, I think in all the years of me being on the internet, I've, um, opened two case files against two people. And, um, one of them is still open. Uh, the other one is closed for now, but can be opened at any time. Uh, so, um, yeah, I mean, you're -- if YouTube isn't going to do anything about it, they don't -- you don't need YouTube's cooperation. The RCMP will handle this. And -- and it is a violation of the Criminal Code, and you can look it up online. It's there. I can't remember what section it is, but, um, it is there. So, this is just to help my, um -- um, my fellow feministos in Canada. Um, if you have any other questions that you want to ask me about the procedure or the process, just drop me a private message and, um, I'll answer as fast as I can with what I know. 
So that's it for now. It's really good to see everybody coming on the, uh -- on the Feminist two group. Uh, that's really, really good, so I'm -- I'm happy that it's growing. Um, I've just been really busy. Um, I got a promotion and I'm moving to Whistler, so, um, yeah, that's -- and of course, near the holidays I'm extremely busy with my job. So, anyway, it's good to, uh, say, hi, to everyone out there again. And, uh -- oh, maybe I'll do my -- my queenly wave. You know, she does that little -- that little wave. Ha. Anyway, um, peace out, blessed be, and ciao 'til next time.
