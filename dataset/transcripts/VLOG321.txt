Hello. Today I was watching an episode of Sponge Bob. And Sponge Bob was at work at the Krusty Krab flipping patties. Then it occurred to me, what do they make crabby patties out of? They can't make it out of fish, because then they would just be cannibals. I know that they have pets like snails and worms. And I know that jellyfish are wildlife, but what do they make crabby patties out of? 'Cause they can't make it out of people? 
Is the reason that Mister Krabs keeps this a secret because he does not want people to find out what he does put in the crabby patties, because maybe, I dunno, it's illegal? Will we eventually find out that Mister Krabs is actually a serial killer that uses people from his community to feed his costumers? Does Sponge Bob just pretend to be young and naïve? Does Squitter just pretend to hate his job, but really he gets half the cut? You know Plankton, I thought he was the good guy. Maybe Plankton is the one --
