Hey, how's it going everyone? Um, it's a quarter to six on Monday. Um, so I just put together a, uh, a clip from not too long into my program. We had a special class where we got to experience Japanese tea ceremony. Um, and so I have a little clip at the beginning of what you're supposed to do when you first enter a tea room. I'll show you that here in a second. 
So there was only two of us that actually came to this, uh, even though there were supposed to be a lot more who were supposed to show up. So we got into the little entryway, the gankong and I screwed up and it's a different kind of gankong than in typical, um, typical homes. This was a special tea room that was located inside the school. So I go in there and I walk in the wrong place with my shoes on, getting a little scolding. Moved into the tea room and -- little thing about Japanese tea ceremonies, they're interesting, cultural, historic -- they suck. It's one of those things, I'm sure -- I haven't climbed Fuji, but I'm -- I'm assuming it's similar to that. It is something you do once to say you did it and then you probably won't want to do it again. I'd probably rather climb Fuji naked than do tea ceremony again. Primarily because of seiza. 
Sitting seiza, uh, sucks. I thought I was prepared for this, I practiced at home. I sat on my carpeting. Now there's a big difference between tatami mats and carpeting, because basically tatami mats is concrete. Okay, it's not concrete, but it's -- it's, you know, the -- sort of straw like stuff, um, I'll show that in another video sometime, but it's -- it's basically they lay it on concrete, um, compared to my nice, uh, carpeted floors. It was not fun to sit on your legs. It sounds easier than it is for me, mainly because I have really long legs. Um, I'm a tall guy, it was really awkward for me to be doing that, but, you know, we got to experience cool little things. They are very particular about how you, ah, take, um, you know, the cups. You have to turn it special ways. I don't really remember it, because I screwed up pretty much the entire time, I did the -- the ceremony, because I kept fidgeting and stuff, trying to get comfortable. 
Um, but yeah, we got to get little Japanese sweets. I mean there's not a whole lot to really tell about -- about the ceremony in terms of specifics. Um, there are definitely resources out there if you want to know exactly how it works, it sort of varies, too. Um, one thing that's interesting, is my teachers there were saying that Japanese tea ceremonies really aren't so much about the rules as they seem, but about doing these -- these little traditions to make everyone feel comfortable and to feel, um, part of this same group and you know, it's really --it's supposed to be about your conversations with each other and, um, you know, just having a good time. That's definitely the main point. But, uh, yeah, seiza sucks, except for my friend Paul, the other guy that was there, yeah, yeah, so he just sat there like there's nothing. He's like, yeah I sit like this every day, ha, ha man. I looked like a retard. 
When I was doing my culture classes, one of the old guys that taught us, he's supposedly like the oldest baseball player of all time. He gave us a little -- little tip that you guys should try out because I tried it and I think it's true. So, we were talking about Korea one day and he was saying that apparently you can tell the difference between a Korean and a Japanese woman based on their legs. Now this is because Japanese women apparently -- apparently most Japanese women have bowed legs, meaning they kind of -- I can't really do it with my fingers, but sort of something like that. You know there's kind of a round gap here, right. Well, apparently, Korean women don't have this and the reason for that is because Japanese women traditionally always sat seiza from like, a really early age and Korean women will sit like, sideways, like. We went out there and, uh, it's very easy to spot, because pretty much all the pants that women wear, especially in Japan -- Japanese women are so skintight there's nothing left to the imagination, so you can pretty much see the entirety of, ah, the leg structure of the woman. So, though I didn't get out my protractor to measure the exact angle that they were bowed, I was pretty sure, ah, from then on out who was Japanese and who was Korean. That's an interesting factoid taught to me by a very, very old, ah, Japanese man. 
So, anyways the, ah, following clip is showing me getting prepared to go in to the tea ceremony.
