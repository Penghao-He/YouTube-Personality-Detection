Okay, so I've just come in, um, from the dentist, and my mouth is totally numb. I'm not even joking, from that side to there, part of it is totally numb, so I thought I'd do a little video blog, because I'm not sure that's been done -- it probably has been done before, but I thought it'd be pretty funny, because little -- oh my, oh my God, it's going towards that side, what the fuck's going on? 
And I don't know who'll see this, um, but I feel like a bit of a freak. Um, I can't thaw half my face. All it was for was a filling, and he got a needle out and numbed me. What's interesting is when I was led there. Um, I asked him; I says, ah, I wonder who invented, um, you know, the chemicals that make you numb. Well, I say chemicals, but I have no idea what you call it. 
And yeah, he mentioned something about, um, the Amazon Forest, you know, how they found it there first and, you know, did their research, which I thought was pretty cool, because I had no idea that it all started in a rainforest. Amazon Rainforest. I think it's a rainforest. Isn't it? I've no idea. Forest, rainforest, same thing; just one's got more rain than the other. 
Okay, an update on the numbness, it's actually still numb, from there to there. Oh yeah, and the reason that I look down there is because it's got like a little display, where I can look at myself. So that's why people are like, oh, what do you look down there for? Why do you look down there? Why don't you look into the camera? It's because there's a little display thing down there, and I looked it just to make sure I'm in -- in shot, and my jacket has magically disappeared. 
Okay, so I'm gonna Google, um, how long the numbness should last. I'm actually search on Google and have a look. Okay, let's have a look, um, dental numbness, uh, plus how long does it last. Yes, I am a really fast typer. Um, yeah. Okay, I'm just reading. Um, typically after twenty four hours your mouth should relatively be back to normal. Twenty four hours -- what? Yeah, I don't know if I can last twenty four hours, God, that's ages. Okay, so thanks for watching this rather, um, random video about the dentist, dreaded dentist, and I guess I will see you soon.
