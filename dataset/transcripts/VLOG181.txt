So Mr. XXXX here got to experience old people driving for a day. Ah, so yesterday I had to go to the grandfather and XXXX, to go get a car, and my grandpa was chauffeuring us --
-- chauffeuring --
-- Chauffeuring us, see I can't even focus. I can't focus. Cha -- chauffeuring us to the, uh, little repair shop, and uh, so, we're half way there and everything's going okay and I'm all proud of him that we haven't killed anyone. We haven't run over any squirrels or dogs. 
-- But he almost broke the mirror off - he didn't even see that. 
Oh, we're going an' the -- the set up of the intersection is, like, there's a left hand turn lane that's going straight, and a right. And we're about fifty feet back --- okay, so there's no left hand turn lane yet, but my grandpa was like, alright, we're gonna make our own lane. So he goes on the left of the cars going up - so we're heading into oncoming traffic. And there are these cars pulling out of like, CVS and stuff, and we're going up and whatever and I'm just like oh my gosh, oh my God, oh my God. And there's this minivan that decides to do the same exact thing we did, that's right in front of us. So he starts to do that. We stop. Then there's this other car wanting to cut in front of us - it's an entire mess. My grandfather's like, ah, what's going on? 
Yeah, but you missed the fact that it was close. 
We --
I mean that van pulled out like, like, a foot from --
-- I closed my eyes, I closed my eyes. I said holy shit, we're gonna die. 
This van was like, it was close, I mean, he pulled out like a foot in front of us. 
Uh, so uh, yeah, we -- we're squeezing on by and people are staring at us. There was an SUV that wanted to take a left in front of us and we were in their way and everything. And we finally get in the actually -- right -- we actually get in the left hand turn lane, finally, and all of a sudden --
I love you --
-- Okay then it's time, like, the light's changing, and all these cars just blowing by us honking their horns, and not just like ar, ar, no, arrrrr, arrrrr. And the whole time, the whole time grandpa's got his head down, and like covered his face, and every car, it's like he can see in his face -- I actually heard him go oh my God -- and every car that goes by he's like, thinking is that it? Finally? And it's like one after another, there had to be like five cars just, and it's just like, from the back of the car all the way past it they're on the horn, each one of them. Every one, like -- arrrrrrrr, arrrrrrrr, you know one after another with the horn. And the oncoming cars were honking --
Oh God, ah, and then the funniest thing is he just, he just blows the whole thing off. And we actually - our plan was to go to McDonald's to steal some internet and he goes oh, we missed McDonald's back there. 
That was so awkward he'd go I'll turn around cos you were like no. 
Oh my God. 
Ahh, yes so don't drive with old people. 
Unless you have your camera going. 
I did have the camera with me, but this all happened so fast that it was just like holy crap --
So we bo you almost lost two bloggers that day. 
Yeah, we almost died. 
Well you'd have lived, I think. I think your grandpa and I, we were on the one side --
Yeah, you guys were on the death side. I was on the okay I'll live. 
I'll crawl out the window. 
Uh oh
That is horrible.
