That's the reason, why do I try to speak out, girl like no know one could hear me. I want to belong here, but something is still so wrong here. 
Hello, YouTube. Oh boy, has a lot has happened since I made my last video. If you follow my videos you all ready by now be able to tell that this is another background then the one I've usually got in my videos and there's one very simple reason to that I moved --
-- Grew up in a small town and when the rain would fall down I'd just stair out my window. Dream what love could --
'Til I touch the sky. Make a wish, take a chance, make a change and break away. 
Right. That was a little montage of clips and photos that I took while we were moving and I just really wanted to use that song as a background because I think it's quite fitting. 
Anyway I'm here now and I officially don't live at home anymore. I left Lemme , the second biggest city of Denmark and I live here with my sister, the wonderful Marie . And I would give you a tour of our apartment, but there's still some moving mess around. I've got box down there and the kitchen still need some work and Marie's room isn't done at all, so that will have to wait. 
And the reason behind my move is that I'm going to start attending university in September and in Denmark you start university on September the first and you get your acceptance letter from the university on July the thirteenth. So yeah, that means that today I got my acceptance letter. This is the letter. And if you don't understand Danish then here it says and that means I'm accepted to university. 
So as of September the first, I'm going to be studying political science. Yeah, I know that some may think that that sounds boring, but I'm really hope that it isn't because that was my favorite subject in high school and so, yeah. 
All right, so I have covered my move and my acceptance letter, but those two are the only new things that has happened in my life. I also got a job. And actually I wasn't planning on getting a job at all, but then my sister in law has a sister in law, I know that sounds silly, and she recommended me for a cleaning job at a hospital that's just near by so I couldn't really say no because it pays pretty okay and it's only every third weekend and I could use the money. 
Moving, acceptance letter, getting a job, I got a fourth thing too. I got a niece and I haven't seen her yet, but I'm going to tomorrow and I have only seen a little picture of her and -- that I have got on my cell phone. And yay, now I have got two nephews and one niece and I think that it's just perfect. 
So as you can understand, my life has been eventful these past days and yeah, I think I'm happy. 
Oh, as a fifth thing that has happened I have cut my bangs. I've got a bad habit of cutting my own hair and it just ends up looking ridiculous. So, I don't like my hair right now, but I have time to cut it before school starts.
