The fuck how I -- uch. I look orange. I do not wash to be orange, thank you, magic computer. I do not want to be orange. How do I change the fucking -- whatever. Technology is such a fucking nuisance. I hate it. I don't want to be fucking orange. Oh, damn you. I look , if I may say so. Oh, look at my lovely nails. Lovely nails. 
Um, I'm going out for the first time, like, in a million fucking years. Um, so um, I'm going to try and bring my camera along not forget and, like, possibly you shall all be invited to come with me. Possibly, possibly. We shall see, we shall see. Um, so there's no light, but that's okay. Um, whatever, whatever. 
So basically, I didn't make a video yesterday 'cause I was, like, fuck this, and nothing's really going on lately, which is kind of awesome. Um, honestly, this -- I'm loving this whole, like, how there's, like, no structure anymore. This is what I've always um, seen for this channel. I never really was so big on the whole five awesome trys -- five days. One day for each person and one post on their day and so much blah la la -- I think I'd rather just post when feel like it and when they actually have things to say 'cause otherwise you just get A, people sitting there with nothing to talk about or people who just don't post. Yes. I would never obviously do such things, but other people might. Possibly, maybe. 
Um, you like my rings? I bought -- I bought th -- this one when I was in New York. I quite enjoy the lady. Lovely rose ring. This one was two dollars and it turns my finger green which is lovely, lovely. Yeah, I like -- okay, I'm going to stop my post. Pimping myself out on the internet. Um, I'm really upset that I'm orange, though. 
Okay, so I just spent two minutes talking about what might upset my friends. Um, whatever. There's nothing to talk about. Um, yeah, I basically, like, I'm about to go out and I just, like, was, like, well I'll use my video, so I'm going to turn on the camera and -- and have a uh, extreme consciousness as it were. Um, I'm really enjoying all of these massive, massive, massive long videos. 
Um, yeah. Lady, Rosie and -- and Jonathan . I was quite amused -- quite, quite amused, by your, sort of, slow decline into nonsensical myth. Well, no, you made sense. It was just more, like, I mean, it's just got very creative or something. It was kind of cool to watch. Like -- like, have it documented um, and such, yes. As someone who doesn't really drink or smoke or do anything like that, but, um, yeah. So, yeah. This is basically the most fascinating three minutes of your life. Don't fucking even lie about it. 
Um, oh so, New York. That's what I should talk about. So, yeah. Um, uch, strange, strange times, strange times. Seeing my family again for, like, ages -- oh fuck, there goes my thing. Kind of weird, um, but, like, what the hell? I got a free trip to New York, so that's good. Um, can you see a little -- no, you can't. 
It's so hard to tell, when you're doing make up, like, what's going to look really, really subtle even when it looks really glaring and dramatic when you're this far away from the mirror and you're doing it to yourself. Yes, and so, um, I have, like, a little glitter eye liner. That's what I was talking about. So, whatever. Um, yeah. Ew, I look so fat, what the fuck? Oof, maybe it's my hair. I need to cut it. Oh my God, stop fucking talking about your fucking appearance. Gee whiz, I'm pissing myself off. 
Um, oh yeah. So I was um, kind of um, I'm -- I'm very bad at documenting things. I'm one of those irritating people who brings a camera and then doesn't turn it on ever. So I -- I want really wanted to make a video with my sister when I was in New York, but I didn't end up doing it. Um, partly because I just was preoccupied with other things that was going on and partly 'cause, like, she doesn't even know what channel, so I'm kind of, like, um. 
Yeah, I told one friend about it, like, a couple months in and then, like, she stopped watching it a while ago. I was, like, oh, great, thanks. So, yeah, apparently um, assuming she doesn't watch it then nobody knows about anymore. Which I like. Otherwise I'd feel kind of, like, censored and weird, yes. 
Um, I'm sorry. I'm just, like, really obsessed with this, like, silvery pearl colored nail polish. I think it's really, really pretty. Yes, quite enjoys it. Um, wow, I'm in a conceited mood apparently, apparently, apparently. Um, so um, yeah. 
Um, so yeah, anyway, so I -- I, like, have a couple -- I might try to throw some stuff together from New York, but I didn't really record anything. I have a couple pictures . Also a picture of my sister, like, her um, her -- her graduation. Um, and that's about all I had so I don't really have anything for you guys. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Well, obviously it wasn't a very exciting trip. It was basically, like, weirdness. Basically I just wanted to see my sister again and kind of reconnect with her 'cause, like, she's really the only person in my family that has still any kind of contact with and I was kind of, like, not really. If I need to cut you out of my life, so that's fine, but I just need to, like, know if that's what's going on or if I should still, like, wait for you or whatever. 'Cause it was just all very confusing. She graduates high school this year. It's a very kind of schmaltish time, I suppose, so I'm just going hang around and see, like, what she's going to do. Shop and lovely sorts of things. It's all a bit up in the air, but um, yeah. It's kind of a -- she might come out -- come out east to somewhere near where I am, but she's staying in Vancouver apparently. Um, but that's fine. Um, yeah. Family, actually devil, you. Deffers. 
Ouch. Um, yeah. Oh, it was my birthday, too. Wait, I don't think I want to say that, but apparently, I just did, so. It was my birthday on the second which was Tuesday, I believe. Tuesday. Um, I did very, very little; as little as possible. It was my roommate's birthday the day before and so I was, like, drinking with them and I don't really do partying two days in a row which is good so I done with drinking. 
'Kay, this is just going downward, so I'm going to, like, go now. Um, but yeah, hopefully you'll appreciate that I'm, like, put something on 'cause I feel bad. I -- I don't know. Feels like there's nothing really -- yeah. 
Oh, I'm finally done in school, too. I had my last exam on Thursday of last week, so I'm finally done in school 'cause it's summer. I might take summer school, but we'll see. We'll see, we'll see, we'll see. 
Okay, I'm going to go now 'cause I'm just boring everyone. So, goodbye and -- and yes, comment please.
