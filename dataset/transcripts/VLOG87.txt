My parents like to constantly remind me that when I grow up I have to marry and Asian wife which is okay. I like Asian women, but I don't like narrowing my options. Girls are like a bag of M and M's, you know, different colors on the outside, but on the inside they're all the same and they all taste good. Hmm, hmm. No one opens a bag of M and M's and goes hey; I'm only eating the yellow ones. You know why? 'Cause that's racist. Hey blue M and M, I don't like your skin tone or your culture or your lifestyle, so I'm not eating you. I only eat yellows. But like most parents, I think the main reason my parents want me to marry an Asian lady is so that we can only have little Asian babies, which I don't agree with. The world needs more interracial babies. I think the only way we can stop racism is to have more interracial babies. You can't be racist to a mixed person. It's too hard. I've tried. Well, you're just mad 'cause you're ah, you're ah, ah -- what the hell are you? No, but my parents really do want me to have Asian babies. I can't even joke around with them. I've tried messing around with my dad, but he takes it very seriously. Okay, so he's sleeping right now. But, I'm gonna to wake him up anyways. Hey dad, wake up, wake up, I have really bad news. I got a girl pregnant. Um it's with a black girl. What! 
I want to change topics. 'Cause I wanna talk about my dad for a bit, 'cause he's very gullible. So the other day I got this phone. It's called a Junebow , a Junebow It's not your regular phone. It looks like a real cell phone, but all this thing does is it shocks you when you press this middle button right here and I'm not gonna lie, it kinda hurts. So I wanted to record someone's reaction and I thought to myself, who could I use this on and it'd be absolutely hilarious and I was like -- my dad -- definitely. 
I love my dad. But that's what he gets for not letting me have interracial babies. So, guys and girls, let's start treating each other like Eminem. And that's all I have to say for now. Thanks for watching. 
Mmm, mmm, mmm, these rolls are so yummy. 
Just say you love me. 
No, why you do that? 
It was an -- it was an accident.
