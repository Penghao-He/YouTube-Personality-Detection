Hello. Is this thing on? Hi, um, XXXX? You know, I was watching your video. I'm a big fan and I was sitting with my mom decorating these little ceramic texts that me and her make every day after church. And she was talking to me about those darn cremosexuals that you were talking to me about. And I -- Ithink that I have a very big -- a very big solution for you. Now, cremosexuals- -well we all know that the cramos-- the cramos are very bad and that, you know, that the God -- God doesn't like those kinds. You know that Elton John and the RuPaul? You know, they are just bad, bad men. 
Shush kitty, be quiet. You know, I love you kitty, I love you kitty. And you know we were talking, I know the gays -- the gays, they upset you with their -- with their -- with their big -- their big gotty glasses and the "I'm still standing better than I ever did. Looking like a true survivor, feeling like I'm going to hell. But no, but no, I'm still standing after all this time, picking up the--" Anyway my point is you know, sometimes if you have to ask if someone's gay because if you don't, how will they know that it's wrong? How will they know that they're -- that they're bound for the hell fire? 
In my Evangelical Kentucky Church that I go to, we -- we sing this little hymn, and I know it's a hymn because my mommy told me. Okay, we sing, "Oh amazing Grace likes boys but didn't have sex until marriage. When she had sex it was only with one guy. Grace only had sex one time, and it was only for procreation. Procreation is the only time you should have the sex scene, have the sex scene, have the sex scene time. "
Anyway, so I -- I really -- it's a big issue that a lot of people have to think about. You know, yeah, and I do understand your question but I don't understand the way that you like sinners. Because I mean God says hate the sinners hate the sin. You know, I've never -- I've never stolen anything. I've never lied to my parents. You know, I just don't understand the need for all that stuff, you know. But some people they just don't have the big one, they don't have the Jesus and they think -- I think that's wrong. Okay thanks Brocket, I am glad that you were touching on this issue because this is an issue I think of before I pray, before I go to bed. Because when I pray, I say, God, God, please help those darn sinners those darn homosexuals, those darn people who don't like this Sarah Palin, tell them that God, they're going to burn in hell. Well I'm going to say bye bye. I don't even know how to use this conflabbit thing. I think I'm just going to -- my brother Jim, he likes that hard rock, that uh -- that I don't give a damn about the reputation. That music, yeah yep, that's not good music uh uh. He watches that -- that Scrubs, yuck. Okay, I'm going to go now. Bye bye. Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye. You know that procreation is good, we know that gays they are bad just like the Harry Potter and the Moulin Rouge and the Gigi man. Particularly I like the .
