It's quite, yeah, it's very -- very sweet little village and, uh, this other clip I'm gonna show you is partly why I love this village so much -- so much, it's, uh, it's very beautiful and this is the evening just before -- the day before we were leaving. Um, and I was taking uh, oh, what do you call that -- call that, um -- um, we -- we were going for a swim, me and my friend, and we hadn't -- we hadn't done that all summer. We both love it -- love to go swimming, uh, bathing, um, but we hadn't done that, because we'd been working so much that summer and we did it last -- the last evening before I left and uh, this is just from that evening. And I'm getting all, like, mmm, thinking about it, because, yeah, she's one of my best friends and -- and uh, it's very beautiful. It was -- it's a very beautiful place, so --
﻿I think we need to go a bit faster if this video is not going to be too long because you're not going to be bothered to watch it. And I've -- um, I haven't yet but I'm going to spend, probably hours editing this, so watch it to the end, okay. 
Anyway, the next clip is, let's have a look, yeah, it's when me and my dad and my brother are leaving the village and, yeah here it is. 
Hi, YouTube, um, it's so good to see you all. Um, I hardly know what to say that it's been such a long time. Some of you are going, who is that? I haven't seen her in ages and I can totally understand that but. . . 
Hello, I'm XXXX, um, welcome, to the new subscribers that have joined us, um, during the time I've been away. I don't know what to say just to -- so we'll just get cracking 'cause there's a lot of clips for me to show you and I just need you to understand them; just give me, cut me a bit of slack here. This is what I'm working with, Okay? 
This is my computer, Okay? And I have to do this. I have to push it, like that, just to get a screen. So, as you can guess, I'm getting a new computer, but this is why it's so difficult for me to make videos. Yeah, so anyway; now that you know that; let's get to the first clip. The first clip I need to show you, is from the summer when we were - um -- just about -- um -- to go off to the wedding. It was the
twenty fourth of July and I promise you, you would meet my new roommate, Emma and you will -- and here's the clip that we'll show you: 
Hello, YouTube. Um, we're about to go to the wedding, I was talking about; and we're going by bus because we don't really have any other choice. 
So here we are. Meet Emma, YouTube, go to meet Emma, Emma, YouTube. And this is us looking all nice and dressed for the wedding and this is our lovely transport and it's going to come down this road very soon. 
So that was Emma. Um, actually the wedding was absolutely beautiful. It was absolutely beautiful. It was actually; I had such a good time. I've -- it must have been the best wedding I've ever been to. I had such an amazingly good time, really. Um, Um, the church that got married in, this is really old church and, and a lot of people get married there during the summers. And just after the wedding, I was there, too. There was another wedding and I think that either the bride or groom must have been Scottish because just when we left, there were other guests coming. And they had this man playing bagpipes outside of the church. And I just filmed it a bit; because a lot of bagpipes. I really do love it. But, bagpipes, that's what you call it. 
Um, but, I'm going to show you. But, you might want to turn the volume down, just a little bit for this clip, yeah? . Bagpipes, one of these days, I'm going to learn to play it. I'm going to play it for you and you will all unsubscribe. 
Um, yeah, after the wedding, I went home to my village again and I helped my dad and brother pack everything up and clean the house and these were like one of the warmest days that summer. It was so warm and this is just a clip that I filmed when I was cleaning out one of the rooms and we'd been cleaning for hours and hours, for days, actually. And we were all just so tired of it so, yeah, we just hated it. And we hated the house; we just wanted to leave. Uh, this is a clip of it and, yeah, I -- I watched it just now and I'm almost -- I'm so glad I'm done with that. Well, anyway, here it is: 
Hello, people! We're cleaning out the house and it's, I'm not kidding but its forty five degrees. It's in the weather and it's so flipping warm and I know, it's been on the record that I have gone through this entire move and this entire clean out of this house singing, "It's too hot, it's too hot in this town. My will to live is melting and that's what's got me down. It's too hot. " and it's still stuck in my head and I can't stop singing it. It's terrible. And it's so hot so it's very appropriate, I suppose. But, yeah, I'm going to keep cleaning now. Anyway, I just wanted to pop in to say, hi, rrrr. 
I just want to show you my village, the village I lived in just bits of pieces of it and the first clip, you'll see, is, just like, um, from the balcony of my friends house and it's not, obviously not, the entire village, but almost. It's not very big. So here's that. 
﻿After that we went down south in Sweden to our family, um, our relatives that live down there. And we spent a few days with them, and some friends of ours. And, uh, that's also a very beautiful place. You should go to Sweden, really, it's a beautiful country. Um, here are just some bits and pieces of that trip. 
This next clip is from when we had arrived in Spain. Because, I went down to Spain with my dad and my brother, 'cause they are moving there, as I said. And this is just a clip of my dad making dinner. He likes to cook. He really likes to cook. Um, and it was the first evening in -- in their new apartment so this is when he -- my dad, cooking. 
﻿You should've been to that taste that because that was really nice. It tasted very, very good. 
Um, and this last clip is just uh, what I filmed on the plane, because the clouds, it seriously looked like you could walk on them. You know, in movies, when they walk on -- on -- on -- on, like, in the sky on clouds? Yeah, it -- just totally looked like you could -- I so wanted to step out and just walk on it. Would -- probably would not have been a good idea, but this is just -- just what it looked like. It was just --
﻿Yeah, so that was it. Um, as I promised you and I know we haven't see each other in a long time. Well actually, it did upload that thing in the Mac Store. Not like I-- that was fun! I've never done that before. And camera, direct upload, I don't know what you call it, um, it was fun. And I have like, a Apple Store -- a, like -- Apple Store clip like everyone famous in the YouTube. Well, anyway. So that was all, I'll see you soon. Um, I don't have an internet in my apartment yet, that's why I'm not on YouTube that much nowadays, but I will get it soon. But it was really nice to see you again and uh, yeah, I'll see you soon.
