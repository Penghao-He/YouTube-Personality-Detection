Oh, hi mah. So something excited has happened this week. I reached a hundred subscribers, which is like the first milestone I wanted to reach, so I'm really grateful for that. Thank you, but you know I wanna be famous, I wanna see my name in lights and stuff, so I think you should all . That would be good. Yeah, no. 
So, this week I was going to talk about of YouTube, but I can do that another time, because this week I made a really exciting discovery that I really wanna talk about. This discovery is Vitamin String Quartet, or because they are American Vitamin String Quartet. One of the things that makes them stand out is that fact that a usual string quartet has two violins, one viola and a cello, but they have two violas instead. I know, crazy right. Don't take my word for it because I'm not sure that's right. I think they changed stuff because I'm not sure it's the same people the whole time. 
The reason I find them so exciting is because first of all they do covers of pop music -- Paramour, mainly. That's the only real one I care about. And, I'm seeing them in a week, just in case you didn't know. And I can play one of the instruments in the quartet. Make sure it didn't happen. Nah, whoop whoop. So now, all we are waiting for is sheet music to become available because I know that they are working on that at the moment, I think. Again, don't trust me. Adudududuududddaa. Uh, oh, oh, and you ever want to -- Jon, you know, I'll just be waiting in the Gryffindor common room. Come up, and yeah, no. Peace and love.
