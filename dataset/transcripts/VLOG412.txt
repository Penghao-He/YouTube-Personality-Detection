Hey, this is XXXX with one A, and when I got home today, holy shit, my video has a lot of views and comments, and all in under one day. So, I understand that a lot of you still don't get why I made that video. Well, allow me to explain why you shouldn't care about the Kanye West and Taylor Swift incident. And no, I'm not making a video, because I care that Kanye West dissed Taylor Swift on stage. I couldn't care less; I've got better things to do than worry about celebrities all the time. I'm just mad because people care about this incident too much. 
So, Taylor Swift wins the award for best video, and after she made her speech, Kanye West goes up on stage, takes the mic and goes, hey, I'm happy for ya, and I let you finish, but let me just say that Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time -- of all time. Ahh, who cares? Is it really that bad that you people have to throw this huge fuss over it? You people are over reacting, and you know it. And just how do we know that you're over reacting? Well, you've been looking busy about this incident in your Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube videos and YouTube comments. In fact, if you posted a stupid comment below, you're just proving my point that people care about this incident just a little bit too much. 
I mean, just think about it. Look yourself in the mirror, and ask yourself am I a little bit too obsessed with these celebrities? The answer for many of you is yes. But, why? There's so much bigger problems in this world to worry about, and we're going to worry and get angry over one celebrity dissing another on stage? Big whoop. 
I mean, let's forget about the real problems in this world, like poverty, starvation, crimes, wars, pollution, bad rap music, people going homeless, people losing their jobs, people getting killed, and these diseases plaguing your fucked up minds. Oh no, Kanye West dissing Taylor Swift on stage is so much more worse than that. What shall we do? 
I'll tell you what to do, you need to let this incident go and move on with your pathetic life. Geez, don't you people have anything better to do than follow these celebrities and their lives all the time? How about worrying about your own problems in your own personal life, first? Seriously, people are just mad because they are popular celebrities, it's Kanye West and Taylor Swift. If they were two Average Joe's then nobody would give a rat's ass about this incident, and you know it. And yes, Kanye West is a douche bag, but let him be a douche bag, that is his problem, not ours. 
I mean, you people aren't helping the situation at all, by being mad at Kanye West and kissing Taylor Swift's ass. Because these two celebrities, honestly, don't give a fuck. They're celebrities, they live in their own little world, and they don't even know that all the over dramatic bad boys and bad girls even exist. So, what's the point? What's the point of supporting a celebrity so bad, if they don't even know who the fuck you are? It's not like you people are going to get rewarded for being mad at the situation, so just drop it and move on. Because, I'm sure both Kanye West and Taylor Swift will make up, and get over this. So, why don't you people follow the example and do the same? 
Grow up, and learn how to let things go. And don't dwell on the past over some over dramatic bullshit, like some fucking, five year old crybaby. And that goes, not just for celebrities, but to all you people in people in real life situations as well. 
And lastly, it doesn't matter if this bullshit happened at some MTV music VMA awards show. It doesn't matter that this happened in front of millions of people and some live audience, because this incident could have happened anywhere, and to anyone, not just celebrities and people need to learn how to take criticism and to defend themselves if they're heckled on stage. If that was me, I'd be like, bitch, I'm the one with the reward, not you. In your face. 
So, in conclusion, people are just being over dramatic crybabies about this incident and they need to let go and move on. Worry about your own life and worry about the world's real problems, and stop worrying about all these celebrities all the time. Because, I can tell you this, these celebrities sure don't care about you. So, have fun crying and being mad over someone who doesn't even know you exist. 
So, you know I have a lot of fans and viewers out there, and I'm sure a lot of you love and agree with this video, but I'm sure there's a lot of you who don't like this video too, and once again, that's your problem, not mine. Because, I'm just speaking the truth and I'm telling it how the fuck it is. And a lot of you just can't handle the truth, can you? Oh well. But you know what, I believe in free speech, and I think everyone has the right to express their opinions without being censored. So, I'll ask, what do all of you people think about this incident? Post your comments in the comments section below and we can have a debate, if you still haven't moved on with your life yet. 
Anyway, this is XXXX with one A, and that's all I have to say about that. Peace out.
