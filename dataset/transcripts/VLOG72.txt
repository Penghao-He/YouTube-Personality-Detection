Okay. Hey guys, what's up? This is XXXX. I'm in the car. I got the night vision on, sorry about that. But hey, this is a message to my young high school listeners and even some of the kids that are just starting into college. Here is my advice to you about college. I have a four year degree. I went to the UC system. I got a Political Science Degree and here's my advice to you. Don't go to college. College is utterly, utterly worthless. Don't hurt your parents. If you're begging off your parents, sucking money off the teeth of your mom and dad to pay for your worthless schooling, don't do it. Don't hurt your mom and dad. They may not have a pension left after that. 
Number two, get a skill that is in demand. Look around. Look at your mom, look at your dad, look what they do for a living. Look at your uncles, look at your aunts, see what they're doing to make a living and then go get that skill set. Most of the time you can get that without going to college. Just realize you're in a whole different environment right now. 
 If you go to college thinking you're going to get some bullshit English Degree and you're gonna become a teacher or you're gonna become like some type of, uh, you know, BA in Business and you're going to get into middle management and make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your first two or three years. This is your wakeup call. This is -- I'm an adult talking to you. Unless you're gonna go and become like a doctor or, you know, maybe like a biochemist. You know, even Biochemists are having trouble getting jobs. 
You know, don't think that you can just keep going to more and more schooling to get a job. The economy is changing. There may not be a job out there for you. Get a skill. And first do your research. Okay, I didn't do this, I'm giving you advice. Okay? Do your research on what actually is paying money right now and then go to school and get that. Or better yet, just go out and do the job. Go out and intern, you know, go work for free if you have to but get the skills necessary to make the money. What I'm tired of is nineteen year old, twenty one year old kids in calls as I talk to you and you guys sound like fuck. I mean it's like I try to put reality into your face and you guys can't even accept it. You're in some sort of la la land and you have no idea what's going on. I've been there, I've done that, you've got to listen to me. If you aim to be like an investment banker, you better hope mom and dad have tons of connections. Unless you got a shitload of connections to get you into some business level corporate type of piss on job or whatever, you're not going to get it through the normal progress. College is over rated. Everybody has a degree. I went for four years, I didn't need to go to four years. Going to a little room with a bunch of dumb ass kids to listen to some professor that probably doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about isn't the way to learn anymore. The way to learn now is to Google it. Whatever you need to know you can type into Google and spend twenty hours learning and teaching yourself or going out -- if it's a real skill -- going out and learn it yourself on the job. Go earn some money. Don't waste time in college. Think about what you can do that can go earn you money. Even if the pay is low, you're going to get valuable, valuable experience by just working on a job. Working on a job is way more -- working is ten times better than going to an artificial university setting and learning a bunch of stuff that doesn't apply to the real world. 
 So that's my advice to you. Get on the Internet. Go out in the real world. Do real things. Realize when you paying ten, twenty, thirty, forty thousand dollars a year for a university education. 
That will be the last thing I have to say is if you're eighteen, grow the fuck up. Just grow up. You're not a little baby anymore, you're a woman, you're a man. Take responsibility for yourself and go out and work. Do anything. I mean, you don't even have to work. Just don't -- I mean go out and be a Beatnik and travel the country, you know, hitchhiking. You're going to learn more doing that then going to some little artificial university where someone's going to babysit you in some classroom. Just grow up, okay? Your parents have ruined this county and they're babying the crap out of you. It's time your generation stands up and says fuck you to college. You know at college. You don't need that, you have the internet. Anything that you can be taught in college you can be taught via the internet. So this is your wake up call. George Sotato to my younger listeners, don't go to college, it's a worthless investment and you won't have all the debt that you have to pay back. Take care, peace out, down with college, up with learning and getting real world experience. Peace.
