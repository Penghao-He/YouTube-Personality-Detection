When I was thirteen years old, I compiled a list of one thousand and sixty three to do when you are bored. This notebook holds that list. And obviously, by watching this video, you're guaranteeing yourself a life of no boredom, ever, forever. 
Number one, draw a picture of the stupidest thing in the room you're in. Number two, find a cookbook and make the strangest flipping recipe in it. Number three, call your grandma. Number four, go outside and lie in the grass. Number five, name your future kids. Number six, challenge your brother, mom, grandma, or whoever's around to a game of Monopoly or a relay race. Seven, read this entire list. Eight, read this entire list again. Nine, keep reading this list until you're so bored that you stopped doing numbers seven through nine on this list. Number ten, take out some pots and pans, big spoons and bowls and bang on them. Number eleven, blow bubbles. Number twelve, call someone you haven't talked to in a very long time. 
So, I'm getting bored reading this list, so I'm gonna skip to um, some numbers and interests such as number forty seven, which is look up the word dictionary in the dictionary to see if it's there. And the best part of number forty seven is that there's a little star that I put there and then if you follow the star to the bottom of the page, it says just in case you were dying to know, it is. 
Five hundred and forty five, go on a quest to obtain Santa Claus' autograph. 
So, five hundred and forty seven is laugh when your dad seriously believes he strongly resembles George Washington. I have no recollection of my dad ever believing he seriously resembled, um, George Washington, or strongly resembled George Washington, or in any way resembled George Washington. Yeah, so I don't know where I got that from, but you guys, if you wanna laugh when your dad believes he looks like George Washington, go for it. 
Five hundred and fifty eight, count your parents' gray hairs. This could take a while. 
Six hundred and seventy nine, make a sculpture of your crush out of play dough. 
Seven hundred and twenty six, snort. 
Seven hundred and thirty six, open and close drawers, randomly. 
So number seven hundred and fifty four is go trick or treating if it's not Halloween, and, uh, it's obviously written in somebody else's handwriting, which I think is funny. Obviously, seven hundred and fifty four was not original. 
Seven hundred and seventy seven, do everything on this list. 
Uh, number eight hundred and twenty is write a book about Scrabble, which is very random, and strange because I'm very obsessed with Scrabble, as of now. I don't remember every really liking Scrabble when I was thirteen. 
So eight hundred and sixty three is make a tossed salad and 864 is toss a tossed salad somewhere. 
Pretty brilliant, nine hundred and seven, say random words in a random order in a way that people think you are saying something really philosophical. And then I wrote, or whatever that word is. But you were really just saying random words in a random order. 
Number nine hundred and seventeen, glue two paper plates together, tell people it is a spaceship and count the weird looks. Take pictures of the people that believe you, 'cause that is kinda weird, cool, or sad. I can't decide. 
Nine hundred and forty one, tape your face, and I put a little star after face, and if you follow the star down, it says okay, not your face literally, but a picture or something. Anyway, tape your face on a one dollar bill, because you rule. 
Nine hundred and seventy eight, make a happy list. Type up a bunch of stuff that makes you happy, give it a pretty border. Print it out and put it somewhere where you will see it a lot, and remember, don't worry, be happy. 
One thousand and sixteen, go to an art gallery and tell people that you appreciate good art, they probably won't care, but it is something to do. 
One thousand twenty six, walk around your block wearing something kinda weird, like a bathing suit, boots, and a bathrobe, see if anyone notices.
