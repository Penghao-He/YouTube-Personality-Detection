Hello, hello, YouTube. Long time no see, huh? Um, so I just wanted to say hello to you guys and give a -- kind of like a little update and everything. I just want to say I have not forgotten about all of you. Just kind of took a break -- a break, since August, I guess. I think that is the last time I made an update weight loss video. So I just wanted to say, I have not forgotten about you, I still check this YouTube channel pretty often, and I'm still following a lot of you guys on your weight loss journeys and yeah. I mean, I kind of have just been a way for a while, school kind of consumes my life when I get started with it. I really hoped to continue make videos throughout the school year but that just wasn't a possibility. I was just so, so wrapped up in school this year, but I'm finally done. So that is super exciting. 
Um, so the end of April, which is about the same time that I started last year with the whole weight loss thing. So hopefully like you know a year later you can kind of get back on the bandwagon and everything else. Um, that's not to say that I've fell off the bandwagon exactly. You know, last year around this time you know I weighed about probably close to two hundred pounds or something like that, and I started on a weight loss program, and I lost close to about fifty pounds, I would say. And, I've kept basically all of that off. Right now I'm weighing approximately, like, one hundred sixty one pounds. So that's basically what I weighed in August. I think that I was around one -- let's see, what did I weigh? Um, I dunno. It was something like that. It's on my main channel page. But I've basically stayed the same. I haven't gained. I haven't really lost. I mean, I guess you can look at that as a little, small victory, woohoo. But yeah! I don't really have much today. Just to say I haven't really gained, I haven't really lost. Yeah. So I've been doing good. 
I've not really been watching what I've been eating. , I do occasionally go and walk at a park near my house. So, but that's not really a whole lot of exercise. I think a lot of you, you know I kind of feel guilty because I feel like some of you, that if you don't watch what you eat every second of the day, or if you don't get in your thirty minutes of exercise, you know you'll gain a pound within like a day. And I've just been very blessed with being able to maintain my weight even when I'm not really trying. And um, I just have to make sure that I don't abuse that and turn that into, oh I can eat whatever I want because I mean, obviously I can't. You know, I can't go out and pig out and eat ice cream and pizza and have a little birthday party diet, what me and my friends like to call it, eating like it's your birthday every week. But, um, yeah I can't do that. You know I still have to try and get a balanced healthy diet with salad, lean meat, um, you know, I don't drink any regular soda. If I am gonna drink soda, I drink diet. I try to drink water or I get those Crystal Lite packets, and I, you know, it looks gross, like pee or something, but it's just the lemonade flavor, Crystal Lite. 
And you know, it's all about moderation, if you want to have you know the bowl of ice cream, eat the bowl of ice cream, but the next day maybe have a bowl of fruit for dessert? I mean, I dunno, I don't always follow that advice. I'm a very good advice giver, I just don't normally follow it, but that's kind of just the things you have to do to try and maintain your weight. You can't just go nuts and it's all about self control. So it's kind of like my little tip of the day. 
Hopefully, I can start making videos again because I am done with school for the year. Um, I'm about to go out of town for the next two weeks. My boyfriend is graduating so I'm about to go and visit him and watch his graduation. That's next week and then two weeks after that, or a week after that or something I'm going on a road trip with one of my good friends. So that will be fun. But after that hopefully I can kind of start making videos more regularly again. 
Um, see, I dunno, there not like a whole lot to say in terms of progress. Like again, I haven't really gained or lost, I keep saying that. I'm sure your like, I know I get it now, okay, gee! Um, but yeah! So just know that I haven't forgotten about you guys and for all the new subscribers that I've gotten, thank you so much. I'm sure your like watch my videos and like okay, this girl is cool, you know I can watch her, and then I kind of did nothing or anything, so your probably like, what the heck? Come on! So um, but no, kind of my, hopefully my little will come back, hopefully. Um, yeah. So, I guess be looking out for some new videos. I kind of have a few things planned so, yeah. I guess I will talk to you guys later. Bye!
