Hi everyone, I like vlogging with the web cam. It's quite strange because, I don't know, it's very surreal. I'm actually staring at myself while I speak. And I can't help but wonder, well who else makes these strange faces, for instance, while I speak. Hmm, I suppose I do. Anyway, I'm just back from presenting XXXX, and then David took a picture of me; just like, just like the new logo. Yay! So you can see that now. 
If you've been watching some of my vlogs before, I probably did talk about different internet sites, and Dick Campbell is one of them that I came across. I didn't actually have fun converted to that and become addicted. But Farm Town might be another one. My mother's addicted to that, but I'm not fully converted to that yet. And I have to say, though, that I am a huge Twist, and I have been for a while. I actually went to um, the Twist in August here, and The Sycamore Club, and if you're on Twitter you can follow me at It's pretty easy to remember. 
So, why am I writing today? Well, I was wearing pink tights. I don't have a full length mirror unless that sometimes happens, but I love my t shirt. My aunt got it for me in Australia. It's very "punny" and a good pun is always good. And I often go to a film festival on Thursday until next Monday. I've never been, which is quite shocking. Yes, I've never been. But I can't wait to go to I've signed up for the master class on Saturday, so it should be great fun. I'll talk to you all again, next Monday night and I'll tell you know how I got on. And I might even make a video or two in -- in Galway. Hope y'all have a great week. I'll talk to you then.
