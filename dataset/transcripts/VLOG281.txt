Oh I love you too, I love you too, yes I do, I love you too. Okay. Check them out. That's the whole world looking at you. The whole world. Emmett, say "Hi". Anyway this is a response to XXXX, she made this video entitled, XXXX, but it was kind of cool I thought. So everybody who watched her video got tagged, just because we're watching, so I'm going to do the exact same thing. If you're watching me, right now, consider yourself tagged. So anyway, XXXX, um -- you wanted five facts about me. All right, okay, let me think, let me think, let me think. Let me think. You know anything about me Emmett? What should I start with? Okay, um, fact number one. Wow. Okay now don't go and tell me to please say something in German because -- 
Like I can actually think of something on the spot, you know -- don't put me on the spot, okay? I came to America sometimes in September -- oh my God I forgot to pay -- September ninety four, yeah. That's when I came to United States and I've been ever since and I have not spoken any German ever since then. So um -- you know it's true what they say, you don't use it you lose it. So I lost it. It takes me about ten minutes to put a sentence together because I really forgot how to speak Deutsch. But I can still understand you, I can still read it, but you know , no don't ask, please. Okay. Thinking, thinking, thinking. Fact number two. What's fact number two? You don't know? I have two of these. This right here's Emmett and Romeo, well who knows where he is, but uh, I'll grab him later. 
Yeah I got two boy cats and I love them to bits and pieces even if they bite me, yes . Bye bye, yep. Fact number three. Yeah, fact number three. I am a empath. Now what this means is um -- okay there's uh -- uh -- there's different kind of empaths in the world but um -- what this means is I am very sensitive to people around me. That includes cats too. It means whoever I'm around, I not only feel what this person is feeling, I also kind of sort of become that person, whether I like it or not. I haven't really found a way to control that quite yet, but I'm working on it. But um, yeah I'm around a whole lot of people I can become drained very quickly because I tend to feel everybody all at the same time and -- woo . It's kind of like taking a ride in a blender, you know, so that's one reason why I can never ride a bus, because -- oh my God! Yikes! 
I'm usually sick for about two weeks after I get off a bus. So I can't do buses because of that. I'm trying to avoid crowds too because it's just not -- it's just not very healthy for me. Okay, that was fact number three, now okay -- number four. Hey I like this bonding thing we're doing here. Let's see -- fact number four. Um -- oh! Fact number four! I'm not smoking anymore! Have you noticed? In none of my videos you see a cigarette popping up no more -- hmm hmm. Yeah, that was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but also the -- one of the best things. Now, the way I got off of cigarettes was with a nicotine patch -- it's called What's it called? Nicquitin CQ -- now that stuff works like a charm. You start with step one. Just slap on the patch, and uh, no more cravings -- completely gone. 
Now the best -- now the best part about Nicquitin CQ for me anyways was at nighttime, when I went to sleep, oh my God, I had dreams in three D and Technicolor. I couldn't wait to go back to sleep, it was like going to a movie. Uh -- you wake up and you -- and you remember almost everything. It was amazing. Yeah, love when that happens. I'm so glad I did it. That's the best thing I've ever done and I -- I swear, I will never pick up another cigarette ever again. I've gotten stressed again after -- afterwards yeah, but still stayed smoke free and I'm a keep it that way. Now that's probably the reason why I gained a little weight, because when you stop smoking -- um -- you're gonna put on a few pounds -- comes with the territory. But I feel a lot healthier, oh yeah. Now -- um -- okay -- um -- um -- um -- um -- um -- what else -- what else -- what else? 
What else -- what else -- what else? Fact number five. Fact number five -- here comes Romeo, come here. Ay ay ay ay ah . Ah, what a moomb . Romeo - hey gorgeous. Now this is my slinky little Romeo. Ain't he a angel? Say "hi" to everybody. You don't feel like it? He doesn't feel like it -- hmm. All right that doesn't really count as a fact but -- that just counts as a cat. So -- gosh -- fact number five. I love making videos of my little sister Stephanie because you know -- the whole impact thing -- the girl takes me to goofy land, every time, never fails. 
Woah. 
Exactly. 
Yeah well I can do this -- Twist it like that -- oh yeah! Here we go -- do it -- do it -- do it -- do it -- do it. like that and squeeze it through your hand . 
I don't know how -- like this? 
Like this, like that I did it! Oh my God -- I'm stuck! Help me! 
She is twelve. When I come around her, I'm twelve, too. So uh -- well -- yeah. Yeah we get pretty stupid, but it's fun, yeah? Geoffrey . Okay and just like Kara I'm a throw away in a fact number six just for the fun of it. Something you probably already know if you've been watching my previous videos, but if you haven't, here's fact number six. I am the biggest Michael Jackson fan in the entire world, yes I am. Oh, let me throw in one more fact. Fact number seven -- I have a new website. It's called XXXX. tk. It comes with a chat. Well I had to make a brand new chat because the other one wouldn't let me in any more for some unknown reason, so it's got a new chat. 
And, come check it out. I know I'm sorry XXXX, I know it took me forever to make this video -- um -- well, there's always something that keeps coming up, so -- I'm glad I finally got around to it because it's been in the back of my mind, like I owe this girl a video -- give it! And in XXXX tradition, if you have been watching me up until now, consider yourselves tagged. I give you seven facts about me, now give me your seven facts. I love this bonding thing, don't you?
