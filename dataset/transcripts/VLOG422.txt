This is going to be a spot the Ken video, so link's down there. 
Okay um, you know how I promised you a response, and I thought I had a good idea? But then I started thinking and I realized, um well, it's not completely out of relevance, but it's not as relevant as I thought it would be. 
Anyway, your video was about celebrities, and how we mis imagine them, um, which I think a lot of people do. They just -- they just, oh my gosh, they're so hot or they're so sexy, and stuff like that. But I think that there are people out there that kind of, I -- idolize them, or look up to them, for some pretty good reasons, and -- and, I think that at certain celebrities would be fitting for the term of a role model. For example, the examples that you gave about acting. 
Um, it does take certain work to get there. I mean, you have to be a good actor to start with, so you kinda have to practice. You gotta join groups and lessons and stuff like that, and you got to work on your own skills. 
But then, you also gotta get out there. Like, no one's gonna notice you -- very rarely anyone's going to notice you by chance, so you really have to go there, you have to go through auditions, you gotta put yourself out there, and that takes a lot of work and a lot of people aren't really willing to do that. 
You know, that whole side of acting and -- and, being in movies, and stuff like that, somebody brought up, and so -- and so celebrities kind of sometimes get a bad rap about -- or they just have a scene in one movie, plus it might have taken a lot of work to be able to get into that movie, and making that movie might have also taken a lot of work. So, most of all, I think, kind of, don't realize that. Most of celebrities also don't expect to be that famous. 
I was watching an interview about the Harry Potter thing, and the actors, that they said that they did not expect Harry Potter to be that big of a hit, and I myself, back when the first movie came out, I didn't expect that -- it to be that much of a hit. So granted that was before I became a fan of Harry Potter. I bet it turned out to be really successful, and no one really expected that. 
So it's not like they thrusted it upon themselves, it was -- it was pretty much -- everyone else was, pretty much, putting it on them. They all watched it, they all loved it, and then it all kind of ties in with I -- I've always been thinking about, how celebrities make so much more money than doctors, and stuff like that. 
You -- you know, you mentioned how they don't really contribute anything good, whereas doctors and people like that, they do. Well, it's -- I think it's where their money comes from. I mean, in terms of being a doctor's -- in Canada, it comes from the government, I think, and in America, it comes from the actual sick patients. Whereas celebrities, their money is coming from anyone who just watches a movie. Basically, if you go and see that movie, you're contributing to their money, and, you know, tying up with what I said before, about not asking to be popular, if it suddenly does get popular, then they make lots of money. I mean, it's just fair right, that they get their fair share of all the profits. 
And I guess the thing with idolizing celebrities is that um, they're an example of where you can go the, but that's if all -- what I just said, like, working hard kind of pays off. Because I think that generally accepted thing about using the arts as a career is that, it's kind of very hard to get into. I mean, yeah, you can do what you like, it's not as hard as, maybe, the sciences, but it's really hard to get into. And, you know, there are a lots of actors that have to move far away from home to Hollywood, and all of that, just so they can, kinda hopefully break out, and many don't, so that's kind of that fear, I guess. 
So in esteem, the celebrities, and their success, kind of inspires them as well -- it's just my thinking. But don't get the idea that I'm completely disagreeing with you. In fact, I think I kind of agree with ev -- everything you said. 
Um, although it's good to kind of have a role model, and it would be pretty great to meet them, standing in line just to get a look, in real life of someone you idolize, maybe not really necessary. Then again, once again, I have no right to say what people can or can't do, you know? I -- I have a lot of things that I'm sure that a lot of people would disagree with as well, but -- hmm. And also, some people kind of go way off in terms of idolizing them. I was watching the Woods show once, where some girl said that Paris Hilton was the perfect role model. I don't know where in that child's life that came from, but I think something might be wrong there. 
Since, to summarize it, I agree with you on points in your video, and I also hope I could have add -- added something to your thought about celebrities. And, just one more thing. Um, you were the one that sent me the email regarding the -- you know -- right? 'Cause, I've never done it before, I'm still kind of freaked out. Sorry if I'm bugging you about it. 
Bye.
