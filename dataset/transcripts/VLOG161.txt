Uh, YouTube, I have a story for you today. Once upon a time, there was a girl name XXXX. Over the summer one day, she had to get up early to go to summer school help. The class was unbearable and annoying, but necessary. 
She came home and checked her YouTube account to find she had a hundred subscribers. That is so awesome! Aahhh! I can't believe I have a hundred subscribers. I know it's not like huge, but it's big to me, and it's just hmm hmm, that's how I feel right now. 
Whoever gave me one hundred by the way, thank you a lot. I don't who my hundredth subscriber is, I don't know how I can find that out, but if you were the last person to subscribe me, I love you, a lot. I love all of you a lot. 
So I think I'm gonna have a happy dance. Hope you enjoy this. 'Specially the hundredth subscriber, happy dance. Oh, I got find that song.
