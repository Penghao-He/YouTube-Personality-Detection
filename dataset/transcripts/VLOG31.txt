Hey guys, it's Wednesday so I thought I would just do a quick, uh, bloggedy blog and kinda do like a little thing, um, but basically I was trying to think of different video ideas and I came up with one that I think could be uh, kinda fun. 
Um, so I moved to Chicago in June, right? But I never really have any time to go exploring throughout the city, feel like I don't really know this place very well yet, so I thought that I could do like a scavenger hunt and you guys could name off a bunch of shit that you either want me to find or go do or whatever and then I gotta take my video camera and go around the city and find all this shit. 
Um, so I think it could be really fun, so I definitely want you guys to list some shit for me to find. But uh, things that I will not find no matter how much you beg of me. First being, drugs. I'm not gonna go find any drugs of any kind, so don't even bother begging. Also that includes drug dealers. I don't have any interest in meeting up with any drug dealers as well as for prostitutes. I don't have any interest in finding any prostitutes at all. 
So yeah, so I'm gonna take a friend with me and we're going to do around the city and do that. I want to do it before Christmas, though, so just name some shit as soon as you can, I guess. 
Um, in the meantime, rest of my day today I'm gonna clean the fucking room 'cause it's a mess, and then I'm going to do a Heliopsis photo shoot tonight uh, for those of you who don't know, it's my brother and his uh, friend Michelle , it's their etsy store, so that could be kinda fun. 
Um, so yeah, so name a buncha shit, then I'll go around the city, it'll be fun and yeah, I hope you guys are having a fantastic day and I will see you guys later. 
Bye.
