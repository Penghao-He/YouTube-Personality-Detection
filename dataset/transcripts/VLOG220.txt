All right, it's been a month, time for some results. Results too -- that I've been putting off for a long time, not because I'm busy because I'm totally like dilly dallying or something. 
The Disney Fact contest. Um, I got tons of interviews, it was a huge shock because normally, things like that, I'm, like, maybe two entries, and now I got like maybe ten, which is a lot, I think. Um, so thank you to everybody who entered. Um, you had a lot of really cool facts, more than I knew um, which is like cool to you know, you know think that actually found those facts out -- wow, I'm a cheesy -- I'm a cheesy? What? I don't know, what? I don't know, that really didn't come out right. 
And some of them, I didn't know, but I was impressed with one in particular that I spent, like, hours searching to confirm it because I thought it was so crazy and so cool. I've was actually stuck between three winners, um but I had to go with this one. 
So anyway, without and further ado, I really want to be dramatic and it put this thing in, like, an envelope. In like, in like, a thick envelope. And the winner of the Disney Fact contest is -- thank you, Nader ! Congratulations Nathan , um. His fact was pretty freaking awesome. 
Okay, so check this out. For those of you that haven't been to Disneyland or Disney World, and haven't ridden on a lot of adventure rides. In the ride, there is a glass window that goes wall to wall, floor to ceiling. So, this wise guy decided to bring in a BB gun on the ride. He shot through the glass window and left a whole in it. Because of the size of the glass, and because of the price that it would cost them to replace it, they just decided to go the easy way out and cover it up with a spider. I thought that was pretty crazy, um, this is Jenader .
