Okay everyone. Um, so today I came across a lot of videos that said Project for Awesome and I was wandering what that was. And, so today it's December seventeenth. Um, YouTube gathers, eh, itself I guess to make videos about different charities and to try to get some money to those different charities. Um, I think it's an amazing, amazing opportunity. I cannot believe what a YouTube has done with that. Um, I was looking at Megan Tonya's video and I was amazed by it and by all the meaning of it. Um, then I looked at makeup by Raisa's video, then I looked at, um, Elissa Nova's video. There were a lot of videos out there talking about different charities. 
And, um, I know I have eight subscribers but I don't care. I think this is a really good cause. So, even if it is only eight people, I want you to know about these. So, the charity that I'm going to talk about is Team Hoyt. Um, what Team Hoyt pretty much is, is a story that makes me cry a lot. Um, so you have the whole story in www dot TeamHoyt -- Hoyt like H O-Y T. com. Um, the thing is Rick, which is the son -- there's the father and son that's the team. Rick was diagnosed as sick quadriplegic with cerebral palsy. So, pretty much what I have read of the story, he could not communicate himself until he was eighteen. And then um, they made, um, ah -- oh yeah -- this is really stupid. Um, The university made a computer for him for communicating with his family. When he was thirteen he could finally go to the public school. Then he went to Boston College -- Boston University, sorry, and etcetera. 
So, in the Spring of nineteen seventy seven, Rick told his father that he wanted to participate in a five mile benefit run from a lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident. Far from being a long distant runner, Dick which is his dad, agreed to push Rick in his wheelchair and they finished all five miles, coming in next to last. 
So -- oh, God. So, they kept running and -- I think up to today, the two thousand and nine Boston Marathon was officially Team Hoyt's thousandth race. Rick always says that if comes down to doing one race a year, he would like it to be the Boston Marathon, his favorite race. Dick Hoyt hopes that he is able to push Rick in the next Boston Marathon when he is seventy years old. 
God -- so, what this Foundation does -- um, it's a non profit organization that was formed in nineteen eighty nine. I am reading it; I do not know it -- but -- like memory. So, it aspires to building individual character, self confidence and self esteem of America's disabled young people for inclusion in all facets of daily life including in family and community activities and specialist sports at home, in the schools and in the workplace. And as I told you before, um, he couldn't go to a school until he was thirteen. So, it's kind of a sad story and -- it ended up really well. I guess and, you know, seeing -- ach, it's just so amazing. So, I'm going to put a link on the side bar to Team Hoyt's, um, website and I'm also gonna put the link to where you can donate. 
I know it's, like, hard times right now, but even if it's just a couple of dollars if you're able to donate then, then just do it. Um, I think you can do it through Paypal and by check. So, yeah, and you can pretty much, um, you know, gather a little more information about it. And yeah, so please support this video, please rate it and comment. Because all they wanna do is put, um, this project for Awesome videos up into YouTube for forty eight hours and -- ah, please go to other Projects for Awesome videos and rate them and comment on them because this is a really, really good cause. And yeah, um, check out Team Hoyt please. I guess it's as I said an amazing charity and an amazing story. And that was it, thank you so much guys, bye.
