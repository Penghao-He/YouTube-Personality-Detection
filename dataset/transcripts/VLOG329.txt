Okay. I would just like to say thank you to everyone who commented and stuff. 
On my last video -- I'm outside to get beautiful singing sounds of the birds. You probably see the evil crow over there. We have an evil crow in our neighborhood. Um, anyway. I yeah, I would really like to thank everyone because you'd not believe how much that helped me. Um, and also people like Millie and Lauren and Mel who kind of ran at me at school and sort of gave me a hug, and I'm not really the huggy type of person but that was amazing. So thank you guys so much. Um, I started eating again which some people say is a good thing. Anyway I got Facebook married to Pedro so me and Lanky are like married now and stuff. Um, yeah. We were talking about relationship statutes anyhow and how Laura wanted to make herself a fake boyfriend so she could be married on Facebook. I'm like, you could just marry me, and she's like, "Oh, I don't want to marry you", and I'm like fine I'll find someone else to marry me then. So I advertised it on Twitter and within like two minutes, um, Pedro was like "Oh, can I marry you? " All right then. So that was -- that was interesting. Yeah. 
I am going to try to keep all my videos positive from now on and when I'm feeling like crap I won't make a video because that last one was really weird and stuff and, yeah. It's finally almost really pretty much spring now, yes. Happiness. It's all like sun when it's actually not. It's like cloud there, but, apart from that, it's bright and it's sunny and it's happy and it's all good. So -- also I have cool earrings of an axe and 'cause my fringe is in the way and a sword but I think they're pretty cool. But I also have some other ones but they're pretty cool too. 
I've gotten really into hand sanitizer. Not product placements that are all bi Aquium but like, like hand sanitizer in general is pretty cool at the moment. There are a lot of bugs. 
Moving on, I want to know who is going to be going to Animania . Animania is an Adelaide anime convention. There is another one -- and that's the phone ringing, but I can't get it. Sorry Mum. Anyway, I want to know who is going to Animania because Animania is going to be greatness in big proportions. I mean it only goes for five hours but like, five hours, that's -- that's just . 
Um, yeah. I wanna know who's going to Animania because I will want to meet you there and I need ideas as to what to cause plans, so I need someone to -- I need you to recommend to me anime and Mango -- no not Mango. Anime things that I could just go to JB hi fi and buy the DVDs of so I can just, in my spare time of which I have none, I can watch them and I can get addicted to certain theories and then I can go cosplaying with that character from that series and be well, yeah, I totally know what the series is about. I haven't only been watching it for a month and it will be all okay. So October tenth, Animania, who is going? Oh, you're not going? I won't be your friend then. Oh, go away. 
I'm saying, please don't leave me. I send my love to everybody who helps me out because you're all amazing and -- and -- thank you. Uh, anyway, um, flowers.
