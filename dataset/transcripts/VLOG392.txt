Okay, so I'm sitting here singing Christmas music to myself. And it suddenly hits me, I don't know how, but um, . And so I'm thinking and I'm trying to figure what day it is and I'm, like, wait, Thursday, no. Tuesday, wait no. Today is Thursday, no it's not and then I realized it is Tuesday, so hi. Um, I'm back, I'm sorry about last week. I was super sick, um, ah, the fever was, like, around one hundred and I've had it for, like, not last Friday but the Friday before through like Monday. So I missed, like, three days of school which means I have a bagillion and one things -- homework to make up. But I'm caught up, everything is all better and I don't have nearly as much, like, sinus issues and all that, so that's always fun to get rid of. And actually I can smell things and I can taste things when I eat them so I'm very glad to have all my senses back. 
Um, let's see here. Um, I'm finally here on Tuesday and I like it. It feels kind of nice except I'm going to have to get used to it because obviously I'm bad at this because I thought all ready, so sorry for it being late. 
Um, thank you for all the diagnosis -- es -- that diagnosis es -- how do you say that? Um, every guess and opinion on my haunted toilet. Yeah, it's crazy. Um, Glee, oh my goodness, the season -- I don't want to say the season finale, but it kind of was; kind of wasn't. 
They're saying it's going to be the same thing when it comes back. Oh my God, but now it was on and it was so good except I want Ben and Rachel be together, but you know what you gotta take the time. He just -- he just found out, so we're going to give him some time. I'm super duper excited. I loved it. I loved it. Who loved the Will and Anna little bit at the end? 
And I cannot stop obsessing over the number that they did sectional and it was, like, the only thing that I really wish would have happened was um, for, like, I would have liked to see them announce the winner at sectionals 'cause I was, like, that's kinda a lame way to introduce and you're, like, ta dah. Well, yeah, but, I loved it. 
I love the show so much I'm just, like, gah and I found out today that uh, Glee has been nominated for four Golden Globes awards. Um, it's, like, for the best comedy or musical tel -- television series or whatever. Excuse me. And Mathew Morrison, Lea Michelle, and Jane Lynch have been nominated um, individually. So I'm, like, Golden Globe after only, like, half a season, that's insane. I'm so happy. And um, the first season or first half season, whatever, comes out on DVD at the end of the month, December twenty ninth, so make sure you all get that. I don't know if I talked about the second soundtrack, but I got that too. It's really awesome
And, oh, this week is midterms week because I don't have school next week. I think you all know what midterms are. So yeah, um, let's see here. Wednesday -- again sorry for yawning -- Wednesday, which is tomorrow, I have chemistry and Spanish midterms and then Thursday I have history and English and then to round it off, I have humanities and algebra two and I've always hated tests. This is, like, this -- these three days and the three days before you have to school are, like, the most dreaded days of the year, but you have to be there. So I don't know. I hate it, but what are you going to do? 
Um, Christmas is coming up. I cannot believe how fast everything has gone by and, like, how, just, like, I think about it sometimes and I'm, like, it cannot all ready be December you know? It seems, like, just yesterday I was turning sixteen in January during the middle of an ice storm and um, by the way, that's all I want for my birthday this year. You know, to not have an ice storm going on. 
Um, so, yeah, it's just crazy. I mean, so many things have gone on and it's, like, I was telling people earlier. Like, my friends and I, we used to say, you know, we used to talk about imagine what it would be like when we we're these big high school kids, you know? When we're big kids and we could drive and when we're teenagers and it's, like, now we are. We're living all the stuff that, you know, we had talked about since we were little. 
And my brother and I -- you know I used to always think, I wonder what it is going to be like when we are big? I wonder what it's going to be like, you know, and I'm, like, I was just looking around the other day and I was, like, oh my God we are big. He's thirteen. I'm sixteen. He's going to be a freshman next year and I'm going to be a senior in high school. I mean, it's just crazy. I'm starting to get all um, nostalgic on you. I'm just kind of, -- I mean just take a minute right now or when the video goes off or whatever and just take a minute and just pause and think about it. And just think about like how much time has passed and just be, like, I cannot even that I'm all ready here. I mean, flows, it seems and when you think about it in general, time passes really fast. So, I don't know. I'm just kind of, like, braah, you know? 
Merry Christmas early, um, I will see you guys next week. Bye. Oh, one more thing um, I will go ahead and ah, closed off with some new pictures of the Glee cast and also some clips from the season -- er, not season but the Volume Two soundtrack, huh, I really, really, really need to get going. I have heard that there's an agent. 
That's it, for real. Bye.
