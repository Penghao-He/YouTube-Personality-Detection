Hey, lovely YouTubers. Long time no speak to you. How are you all? Hope you're good. As you may or may not have noticed, I put a video up yesterday. It was a video that was made for me a very long time ago by some lovely people -- really lovely people that I consider -- meeting those people was one of the best things that ever happened to me. 
And they made for me a birthday video to the tune of, um, you don't have to be rich to be my girl. You know, Prince. Kiss, that's the one I was thinking about, that one. And Prince is particularly fussy about um, copyright issues and stuff like that, so needless to say the video was uh, taken down within, like, a second of it being put up. Um, and for that YouTube sucks major arse. Really big, big bottoms. 
How have things been in the land of me? Well, my kid had -- had his operation, tendon -- tendon lengthening on his foot and leg -- four different operations in one go. He's in plasters still. 
Um, he started a new school, which has been a fucking nightmare. The transition to that -- he's fallen God knows how many times. He's hurt himself God how many times. Some kid came up to him in school the other day. He had, um, Sam's got, um, you know one of those big shoes they give you to put one when you're wearing a cast. He's got one of them on. Some kid walked past him and said, hey, nice shoe, spacker, where can I get one? Of course, Sam told me about this and I saw the kid the next day. And, uh, I gave him a nice evil look, you can imagine. And he looked at the floor and went all red and walked away really quickly. Next time I see him I'm going to drop kick that motherfucker. 
Um, quite the t shirt -- Wonder Woman. I actually bought it after going to the gym. I started the gym again, um, which I am completely loving -- three nights a week. Um, with a couple of friends and it's awesome fun. Nice to get a good workout. 
It's Saturday which means my lovely, lovely sister is coming to see me today. And my brother won't be because he has a job now -- his first job. 
I'm just looking out the window, sorry. This is why I can't -- I just don't make YouTube videos anymore. I can't, like, keep my attention. The painters have been outside painting the house and it looks like they've just crushed several of my plants, which was really considerate of them. Not my day. 
Um, I don't know what to say. Bye.
