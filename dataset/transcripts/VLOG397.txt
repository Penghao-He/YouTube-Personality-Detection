Hey, this is gonna be my second video blog and I figured since I skipped out on introductions on the first one and immediately started complaining about my dorm mates I should let you all know a little bit about myself. 
Um. As I said in my first blog, my name is XXXX, XXXX like music. There is an interesting story behind that. My father is a musician. My mother is tacky. They thought it would be good to name me XXXX. It's a nice name so I can't complain. And it rhymed. Anyways, um. I'm a freshman in college, I won't tell you which college I'm going to for the sake of privacy, but I am a freshman planning to graduate in two thousand and twelve. Um. My major is Art with the focus on illustration. I drew this, it's pretty isn't it? And I am obsessed with reading, the internet, video games even though I suck at them, and arty stuff in general. And I am eighteen and taken, so bad. 
And I think that's about it. Now that would be a really short blog so I guess I should talk about something else. Let's see here. I will talk about vampires because I've recently read a vampire novel by one second -- uh, by Amanda Ashley. This is one a series I think and it's called, 'Night's Kiss'. It's totally a housewife's novel you know, the romance, and the scary, and the danger but everything ends well at the end. It's definitely a housewife's novel, which makes sense 'cause I got it from my mother. 
And I am also um, this is the first season of True Blood, this has just finished. And I honestly think it is probably one of the awesomest things ever. And I was really interested in seeing because first I watched True Blood and then I read this, and in both of them silver can hurt vampires. I found that actually very interesting that more than one author thought that, um, silver can hurt vampires, because the True Blood series is based on the Sookie Stackhouse books written by some lady but apparently I'm supposed to read them immediately so I'm probably going to be stealing them from a friend shortly. And also everyone has been doing it, everyone has been talking about Twilight for some way in or another, and really it lost -- I lost all respect for the books because --
Oh hey, my dorm mate's coming back. Hi. I'm doing a video blog. 
Oh, you are? 
Yeah
Cool
Anyway, so anyways, my -- I lost all respect for the author when I found out that Twilight was an allegory for waiting until marriage and how women are horrible temptresses because you know in the book Bella is totally into Edward and Edward's telling her to go away and all that crap and also because vampires sparkle. Now I got into an argument with a classmate in my English class saying that vampires don't sparkle they radiate, they radiate light. Sorry sweetheart, they sparkle. And honestly the entire thing seems like so horribly Mary Sue to me that I just -- I can't read more than I already have, being in bookstore, picking it up and flipping through some pages. Um. I guess that's a long enough blog then. Nice meeting you and I'll talk to you guys again.
