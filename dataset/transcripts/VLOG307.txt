Hey. It's me, XXXX. Um, coming to you today. First we showered. Had a big company softball tourney today. Very interesting. Basically, caked bouteay , you know. Um, three games, won two, lost one. But, uh, I didn't suck that much. 
Um, what the hell is up with team spirit? Team spirit. Co eds -- what do we know -- what am I doing? Rabble, rabble, rabble . Team spirit. What is that? Um, when you're supposed to be nice to the other team. What is that called? Sportsmanship. Where the hell has sportsmanship gone these days? Ah. 
We were at a company softball tournament, right? And this one team accusing us of cheating. Us of cheating in the softball slow pitch, right? Right. P. S. Slow pitch sucks. This little squatty, squatty five foot, four foot, nothing something or other, curly q hair guy, he starts talking smack . It's a game. It's a -- the -- the winner's got a trophy, just a huge trophy. It's like, where the hell am I gonna put a huge trophy? I don't want the f'ing trophy, you know? But apparently he really wanted it. Probably the only thing he'll ever win in his life. True. Not really sad. Very true. 
You know, when you -- uh -- when somebody is talking to you and they say something rude and you -- and you know -- like you -- you think about it and you're like, hey, hey, I should have something clever to say about that, something. And you're inside your head and it's going and then you're like, oh my gosh, has too much time gone past? Do I still have -- do I still have -- is there still time to retort? And, uh, you're -- you're sitting there, standing, laying, whatever you're doing when somebody says something. I mean do you -- that you -- you should say something mean back, too, or at least something clever? I mean, redeem yourself or -- you just don't let them win at all costs. Never back down. Never say die. 
So, uh, that happened to me actually a couple times today. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was the sun or maybe it was the Long Island I drank before the game. This mo fo said me things numerous times and every single time -- every single time I couldn't think of anything to say to him. Until later, you know. You know, when somebody says something mean. You guys just a bunch of cheaters. You couldn't win a game to save your life. And then you come back at them with, yeah, well you're short, you're -- you're face is a cheater. Uh. 
And you really wish you would have said, oh my gosh, why are you even talking to me? You're voice gives me a headache. Who are you? Your balls reek and I can smell them from here. Your mother's a whore. 
But you didn't. And you always think about the responses or your clever comebacks like way too late 'til where you can't even come back. Like sometimes even years. And you're like calling up them on the phone and be like, hey Stacy remember that one time you called me a whore? Well I did your boyfriend so who's the whore now? But it never really has the same effect. 
So that little man got the best of me today and I'm gonna have to go on with the rest of my life always knowing that. Maybe it's a sign that I should focus more on the game and a little less on the party. Come on. Right. Purple . Purple nurple a. k. a. loser, curly q. I got the best of you. Kinda, I still beat ya', bitch. Field that.
