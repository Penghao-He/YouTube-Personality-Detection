So what you have to do is, go to this website that I'm gonna put down here, it's gonna be here for the whole video, and all you have to do is click one button. 
And through clicking that one button you can feed an animal, and that, a shelter. So if you feel kind of like you can't do anything to help them, like I do, you actually can. 
And I know that pets seem like they're not a big deal compared to other charities, but I love animals and I would have one hundred if I could. 
So this is what I do to help out, along with adopting pets and I encourage you to do the same. 
Okay, thanks. Bye.
