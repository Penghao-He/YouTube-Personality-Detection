Yiga Kiga for sure, nostalgia critic because I think he's funnier than the AVGN, even though AVGN has more nostalgic videos, and my favorite animal of all time has to be dogs. I mean, I love dogs. 
Hello dearest friends and subscribers. It's AG and I'm here to answer your questions from last week and boy, do we have a lot of them. What would you say is the best Zelda title? Wouldn't it be at the top if they made a Zelda movie? What's your favorite band, song, genre? Well, if they made a Zelda movie, I would be totally psyched for that. And to be honest, it's actually a big dream of mine to direct a Zelda movie. That would be the pinnacle of anything I ever direct in my whole life would be a legend of Zelda movie. Not sure if I can do it, but in a fan film, I can definitely do it. But, um like a Hollywood feature film, I would totally go see it, totally. I don't really have a favorite band, but my favorite genre of music has been like R and B , Rap and Hip Hop. Why? Because I kinda grew up with, so it's just ingrained in me. And yup, the music nowadays is not as good as it was when I was growing up. But, saying that makes me feel old, but I do believe that. And my favorite song probably has to be Iris, by the Goo Goo Dolls. What are your thoughts about Nintendo to bring back the Koopalings in news from Meyer Brothers Wii. Well, it seems that Nintendo only thinks the Koopalings belong in two D , but I would love to see them in a three D game. That's all I have to say. You know, I didn't really schedule when is coming out. How about you give me a reasonable date? And I'll try to do it by then. To be honest I'm not really interested in the Zelda hand held games. They are kind of continuing where Wind Waker left off and, ah, it's not a big deal. 
Who's the one person you would really like to meet? It could be anybody. The one person that I would really like to meet is Robert Rodriguez, because he's the one that really inspired me to be a film maker and showed me that you can make a movie with a shoestring budget as long as you are really creative and have a good story. 
If you could remake any movie which would you do and why? I really wouldn't remake anything. Um, remaking movies in Hollywood, especially this decade, has been a business of its own because of our economic times that we have been going through lately. And, ah, it's usually, it's just a big marketing strategy because, ah, Hollywood knows that if they remake something from the past and you're familiar with that franchise you're more likely to go see that than something that's original. Because you might see something that's original and, like, oh I don't know about that movie. I don't know if I should see that but if a new Miami Vice comes out, a new Friday the Thirteenth, a new Nightmare on Elm Street. Oh wow, they remade this movie. I know that movie. I know those characters and then you go pay to see it. It happens all the time and that's what's making money for Hollywood and they're going to keep doing it until they run out of remakes to do. And then they are just going to be remaking the remakes which makes a lot of sense. 
Why don't you do any more movie giveaways as a movie messenger? Well, in the beginning I was giving a way DVDs but then when I did As Good as it Gets and Marley and Me I had contests for those videos and nobody participated. And I had bought four copies of As Good as it Gets and I bought a really good copy of Marley and Me. And I spent like fifty bucks on those and nobody participated in the contest, I was like, wow, that was like a waste of money. So, then I just threw away the contest thing and I was like, eh, forget about it. And, ah, that's that. But I do plan to bring back the DVD giveaways in the future. So, don't worry about that, um, it's going come -- come again soon. Okay? 
Do you like heist movie and if so, what is you favorite? And if Nintendo suddenly went bankrupt, what would you think you would do? And if Nintendo went bankrupt, I'm pretty sure either Sony or Microsoft would buy them. If the internet died, what do you think would happen? Chaos would ensue. Do you know the movie preview critic here on YouTube? No. 
Well, basically, this question's asking me, would I rather play Ocarina of Time for the rest of my life, or watch The Shawshank Redemption for the rest of my life? I would have to say, play Ocarina of Time for the rest of my life, and here's why. Because, I think if I watch Shawshank Redemption, like, a million times, I would probably get sick of it. 
But I think, if I was, like, deserted on some, like, desert island, and I had to play Ocarina of Time, em, it wouldn't be as bad, because, I mean, even though I'd be alone, and you know -- think about, like, that movie Cast Away. Like, if I was like him, and I was on that island with Ocarina of Time, I would probably just talk to the characters on the screen like they were real, kinda like he did with the volleyball. I'd be like, hey Madeline hey Talin; how's it going? You know, just walking through the stages, and talking to all those townsfolk like they were real people. I mean, I'd be crazy, but I'd at least -- I'd have friends, sort of. 
I actually love the Smash Bros. series to death. Um, bear characters to use the regular Smash Bros. Pikachu, Smash Bros. Melee Pikachu, and Smash Bros. Brawl/Kirby, because they give to Pikachu. Best version? Melee, 'cause it's a lot harder and takes a lot more skill to play. 
What are you thoughts about the remake of the 80's animated movie Akira? And have you seen Battle Royale yet? Uh, the remakes again. Uh, they should be fine; I don't know. I mean they're remaking everything so, who knows? As long as they don't make it like that Dragon Ball Z movie that just came out, it should be okay. And Battle Royale? No, I haven't seen it, but I will let you know when I do. 
What was the most violent movie that played as you were growing up? Believe or not, it was Mortal Kombat and that's why I loved it so much. And that's why parents were whooping out about it and that's why senators went crazy over the violence. And if you play it today? It's pretty damn tame. 
Would you consider doing A Link To the Past Walkthrough, and what is your opinion on remakes in general? A Link To the Past Walkthrough; that would take forever to do. Um, do you ever need A Link To the Past Walkthrough? Mmm, I don't know. If you really want one, I'll think about it. I want to make my Walkthroughs kinda different from other people's Walkthroughs. I want 'em to do interactive. So if there's a way I can figure out inter active, sure, I'll do Link To the Past. And I think you already heard what I said about remakes, so I don't believe you should do one. No. I mean, Hollywood's only doing it to make money, but that -- that understandable. 
What's your favorite RPG? I think I answered this one already, but if I didn't, it's Final Fantasy Nine. 
What games out there that are loved by everyone you don't like? In my last question I asked, "What you up for a series? " Well, I have another. What kind of structure they use to make it look good? Lighting, camera angles, that kinda thing. 
A game that everybody likes that I don't like? Freaking Halo on Xbox. And more tips to help you make your web series. It's gonna take forever, like, a whole other video to do, so I'm gonna put links to the description to help you out their YouTube tips to help with your lighting and your videography and that kind of thing. So that should help you out, and other links to other sites and that can help you out too. 
﻿Do I like Polk fiction? Man, this movie is amazing and this DVD, just a collector's edition, has so much bonus material, I just couldn't stand it -- it just -- this is what DVDs are all about. So if you haven't -- if you don't have this DVD, it's a collector's edition of Polk Fiction; I recommend it -- highly recommend it. Um, I love Quentin Tarantino's movies. 
I just bought In Glorious Bastards on DVD -- bought this one at Target 'cause it came with a soundtrack. Best Buy was selling this for twenty four ninety five, just by itself, but if you buy this at Target right now, it comes with the -- the movie soundtrack too, so that's pretty freaking awesome. 
Favorite TV show of all time is the Wonder Years. 
What are your thoughts on the Catsylvania series and the direction it took after Symphony of the Night? Well, on the NES, I had all the Catsylvania games as a kid. I loved number three the best, because you can play as different characters so I always played as Aloe Card, um 'cause you can fly around with a bat and pretty much fly over like the whole stage. I mean, if you have enough magic. And I played the Super , Super Catsylvania Four, which I thought was pretty amazing. 
Then when I got to Symphony of the Night, it was a really great step up for the series, but since then, it's like all the games are trying to be like Symphony of Night, but not as good, so um, I'm not really excited about the newer ones all the time, because they're always -- mimic Symphony of the Night, like the and the DS. I've kinda played a couple of those. I was like, ahh. It's just like, been there, played that.
