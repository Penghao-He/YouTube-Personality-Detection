So this is a quick video response to YouTubers exposed by XXXX. Regardless of this video in the negative things he has said about me in live shows, Mr. XXXX is probably one of the funniest fucking people on YouTube. Realist, I'm not going to say that, no -- um, but funniest yes. And his ability to handle the internet audience is something to be admired, because mother fucker, oh my God, do a lot of people believe the bullshit coming out of your mouth. 
And you know, a lot of it is true, a lot of it is true; but when you are talking about people using -- everyone that uses question of the day, post on a regular basis; saying that makes them sane. That makes no sense; posting on a regular basis has existed ever since there was fucking media. If newspapers came out randomly, I wouldn't know what the fuck was going on. I know that in the morning I can go up to the newsstand, holy shit there's a newspaper; right on time. I guess that makes me stupid that I got a scheduling shit that when I turn on the radio, I go, oh shit, the MJ morning show is on. That shit is not randomly popping up, it's seven PM. 
And the question of the day is misused by many a person, because they see people using it and they're like holy shit that works. I didn't invent the question of the day, it was invented by the first person whoever had an opinion, who wanted to know other people's opinions. And it has been bastardized on YouTube, you make a video, it's like, do you like turkey? Check yes or no in the comments below, because it helps my video. That rhymes, yay. 
And there's a lot of shit that goes down on YouTube that pisses me off, but you realize that it's part of the game and you've just got to deal with it or eventually those people will fuck up. There are a lot of people who gained an audience doing bad shit. There were people spamming; people with messages like hey remember me, subscribe to me; or like back in the days when people fluffed their views like SMP films, using a video reloader. It wasn't him it was a friend doing it. 
Another thing that got me was when XXXX said, you know all these fake mother fuckers, but YouTube needs to feature people like Charles Trippy and Timothy. Okay, I love those guys, but if I don't see a video that they posted with some sexy thumb nail title of Hot Chick Does Blobbedy, Bla, Bla, Bla, I am shocked and they are playing the game just like anybody else. 
The summary of this video is yes, it does annoy me with the shit that goes on with YouTube. Is it everyone? No, but yes it does annoy me when people cheat or at least in my eyes cheat. Like a child that gets their videos audio spotlighted, because there's a dude that works for YouTube that has invested in that company. The way I have justified it is everything is kind of bullshit even you XXXX, coming off as the savior, the man showing you what is behind the curtain while he has an ad for MacDonald's, to the right of his video. But XXXX I do enjoy you videos, even though your white voice, Mr. XXXX, and I really wish you would post on a regular basis because those mother fuckers want to see your videos and to you guys watching this video; if you are one of those people that's like Phil has taken the suspension and he's doing this; and if you're that stupid then just unsubscribe to me. It's hard to do on the internet, but I would like to minimize the amount of stupid fucks watching my show; or continue watching me and hating me; because haters pay the bills; that's just something on my mind. See you next.
