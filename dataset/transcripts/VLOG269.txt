Who in their right mind actually uses these things? Hey. Argh! I have just filmed seven minutes worth of me talking, and it has just disappeared off the face of the earth. I'm not happy. I'm not happy whatsoever, but I do have something still to talk about now. Yeah! Firstly, um, I'm trying to make it sound like I have many things to say, but I really don't. To start with, it's about the same thing. Um, right. 
So, last video, I suggested that I could use some of your suggestions for my next video. Um, to be honest, they weren't that impressive. Uh, the best one was from Paul . Uh, he said I should interview my band, uh, which I will do when I'm with them sometime soon. I'm only with them once a week, um, so I'm not too sure when. But it will happen; I promise. 
If it sees this , um, it's my sister's, but I only put it on um, to cover up my greasy bad hair, which you can see is bad already. Ew, Hob Nobs. They look fresh. Okay. Ooh. But this whole interview thing could be a good idea to get famous. You never know. 
Gibo nineteen eighty eight uh, he -- is he still on YouTube? I haven't looked. I guess to me, but he -- he used to make um, interviews where the You tube is, and it was good. He think he got kind of a lot of fans out of that. 
I -- I came across someone I used to subscribe to on my old channel um, XXXX. He was a presenter on the children's BBC in the past, and then he's come all under great internet things. Uh, he's on uh, a channel called Mr. Holy Moly and pocket TV show, and he's quite published; he's quite famous. I -- I like him; I want to be him. 
He met Mr. T randomly and got to interview Mr. T. I want to do that one day. He would probably be dead by that time, but I still want to do it, just the grave Mr. T. So, um, how's the A Team? Really? Good. 
And Skype is jumping up and down at me, but I'm not going to click it because the last time I went off this recording thing on iMovie, it went off. So you have to wait for me, someone, whoever it is. 
Here's another thing. Um, last video was a bit bad because I did it on iMovie HD and the settings I used for it didn't save. So I had to readjust them, but I didn't do it properly. So it kind of changed some of the settings, but the rest didn't connect with that one, so it's all out of tune with each other. So it's all pixeley and the quality was not that good. Hopefully iMovie zero nine will do this better -- hopefully. 
On bass, I'm trying to learn all the frets uh, from what notes to play so I can adjust to new songs and automatically know what chords to play at what bit and where it is on the fret board, but it does take some time. For example, there's no such thing as an E sharp; it goes E, F. Um, I wasn't kind of aware of that at the time, so I was like, what? What's with the gun ? Or a B sharp, either. What? 
Yeah, we're writing some more originals when we meet up. We've got two so far. Uh, hopefully we can get three by the end of the week. As usual, I'll keep you updated. Right. 
I'm going to go now because I think I've -- I've done an adequate amount of footage to whittle down into a smaller internet screen where you can see me and uh, it's been eight minutes, so it's going to take a while to edit, but I'll do it anyway. 
I -- I'll see you in two days.
