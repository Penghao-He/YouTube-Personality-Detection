Hey everybody, how's it going? It has been quite a while since I have done this, uh, and I'm sorry about that. You know what? I'm actually sorry for you that I keep saying sorry for shit. Umm, seems like anything that I do I take long hiatuses on. I just, my attention span is very, very small, uh, even with things I like. And, speaking of things I like, here, I have a new game plan for Christian's vlog. Um, I just don't seem to have it in me to be, ah, be witty, and have some kind of idea and themes to each different vlog. Um, the ones I did before, you know, they were fun, but I just, that much production going into it -- not that it was Spielberg -- but, you know, transitions, and fancy stuff, I just don't really have the time for anymore, but I still kinda wanna put things out. 
So, what I was thinking of doing, was sticking to something that I could pretty much turn out pretty quickly. And it doesn't take much work, and I think people will enjoy it. Um, so I'm gonna stick to what I know, and that's music, as you can see. If you can only see this side, it's, uh, music crazy with lots of gear. Anyways, um, so yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna start playing tunes instead of getting drunk and filming it. That was fun, but I've done it, so I don't need to do it again. Umm, so that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take requests -- but here's the catch -- to give me a little bit of control over what I do. Rather than just randomly taking requests, so that I don't get, you know, some ridiculous songs, um, I'm gonna take requests by year. So, people can say, you know, nineteen seventy six, and I have to pick a song from nineteen seventy six to play, or nineteen eighty five, or nineteen thirty two, you know? 
Obviously the farther back you go it'll get a little more fun for me to try to find something to do. But anyways, that's what I'm gonna do. So, put your requests in, down in the comments. Umm, it's -- I -- I don't think it's gonna be like whoever comments first that's not what I'm gonna do. I think I'll just randomly pick one, um, to give everybody a chance. 'Cause there's people who, and you know who you are, will probably watch this very quickly, like, as soon as I put it out, and there's people who won't see it for a week. So, I want to give everybody a chance to -- that wants to -- to uh, put, uh, Jesus, I'm just losing track of what I'm talking about here. Alright, I'm good. Um, I want everybody to have a chance to put in a request for a year. 
I'm sure most people start with their birth year, but then once you get past that, you know, it's kinda fun ta -- to you know, hear me do a tune that's from the forties, or you know, something like that. And of course, being me, I'm not just gonna -- I'll probably be doing them acoustic, um, 'cause, you know, there's only one of me. Um, so, it'll be fun. And of course I'm going to do them in my own style, so even if it is from the forties I might, you know, try to do something else with it, but, anyways, that's what I'm doing, that's what this vlog is going to be from now on. Maybe I'll pepper in, you know, some kind of goofy one once in a while, but for now the -- these are the type of vlogs that I can handle doing and putting out, hopefully on a semi regular basis. So, thank you for everyone who has subscribed. 
Hopefully, um, you won't umsub -- you won't um -- you won't umsubscribe -- you won't unsubscribe just because I'm only doing music now. But uh, at least it's more interactive, everybody likes music, and I will take a stab at different years. So, comment, and thank you for watching, and uh, have a pleasant day, evening, wherever you are, year. Okay, that's it.
