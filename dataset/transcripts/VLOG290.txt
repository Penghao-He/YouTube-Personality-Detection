Part three. Okay, um, the argument against homosexuality is that, aside from a biblical sense, is that a lot of homosexual -- allowing homosexual people to have children would be detrimental for the children. And let's back track a little bit and review why, apparently, it would be detrimental to the children. 
No. Let's backtrack a little bit and discuss the idea of homosexual marriage. The idea of ho -- actually let's backtrack a lot and discuss another reason why you wouldn't want to give homosexuals marriage. Namely that marriage should only be give to groups of people that are -- procreate. So the argument of religious people, and they don't have their precious bible to back them up, is that marriage is a function that is and always shall be, solely for procreation. And since gay people, you know, it -- it doesn't work, you know, and lesbians, you know? Not much getting done there in way of procreation. Not much getting done in the way of procreation in a, um, homosexual relationship. That's honest. That's true. 
And I've heard this argument a million times before, so I'm just going to say it again, old people can't marry then, infertile people can't marry then, you know, um. What about, uh, women who have gone through menopause, can they get married anymore? And then if the couple should get married and decide not to have children, you know, are they, like, committing some grand atrocity? They decide not to populate the chil -- they decide not to populate the Earth. Or, what happens if a couple has kids and then neither of them can have anymore kids? All of the sudden, should the marriage just be erased? 
The true definition of marriage is not an idea of procreation. Certainly that's -- certainly, it's part of it. But the original definition of marriage was an ide -- was a social contract for a male to gain property, mainly the female. The female was considered property. Now, that really throws it in -- that really, sort of, throws a wrench in the whole operation when women all of a sudden aren't considered property anymore, you know? Because, all of the sudden, you know, it's not an idea of property. 
This idea that marriage is -- is for love purposes, it really is a twentieth century idea. You know, of course we've carried it into this century, but it has not been around for more than a hundred years or so. Um, marriage was a contract. It is a contract, still. It's a social contract. You're stating to your governing body that you two are going to sort of coexist -- co -- uh, you're going to exist as one; let's just say it that way. So, in exchange for entering into this social contract, the government gives you certain benefits and that is a lot of what this argument is about. 
For fighting for gay marriage benefits is that, it's not even the title of gay marriage that we're getting after. It's the idea that if you do not allow gay people to marry, you're denying them these benefits, these rights that are granted to heterosexual married couples. Heterosexual married couples have almost number -- an almost infinite number of rights. 
Like, the, just so you know, the most -- the most obvious example, um, like, if one -- if one partner is in the hospital, the other partner can go in there. They're treated as family. Now, if a gay couple, if one of the -- one of the partners was to be in the hospital, the doctor can tell that person not to go in. They can keep them out. Because they don't have to. Because they're not married. 
And I'll get into the -- the idea of civil union versus marriage. I have my own opinion about that, but, um, yeah. So the idea that homosexuality in marriage will destroy the American family. I just have to say, I feel sorry for people who are so insecure about their own marriages that they have to blame homosexuals for destroying their marriages. The only marriages homosexuals have ever destroyed are sham marriages that homosexuals entered into to protect their own identity. And the only reason they destroyed them is because they were honest with themselves, so you know, really, homosexual marriage --
