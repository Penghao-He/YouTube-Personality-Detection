Hi everyone. Um, a lot has happened in the last week, so I'm just gonna tell you what all I've done and I have a book to talk about, so let's get going. 
Okay. So over the past week I got a book called Dream Boy and, um, I really didn't think it was gonna to be super good, I just thought it was something to do. It's, ah, only, like, two hundred pages -- a hundred ninety five or something like that and, um, it took me two days to read and I -- like I usually don't read books fast and I don't read books at all if I don't like them that much and this was really, really good. Like, um, the summary of it I would say is like this kid has an abusive relationship with his father and, you know, he's gay, so he finds a guy and all this other stuff happens and then the ending is like really deep, and if you can understand the meaning of it it's like -- it's a big deal. I don't know. I really liked it. So if you've ever read Dream Boy or seen the movie then just like, leave a comment below. I've never seen the movie, so I -- I want to see it, but I've never seen it. I don't know if it's like appropriate or not, but anyways -- yeah. So, there's my rant on the book. 
Also, I've realized lately like there's a couple of people that I really want to catch up with, but I kind of, like, am afraid to, and I don't know why. Like there's no reason that I'm afraid to, I just. Like, have you ever felt that way where you can talk to someone, that you like really enjoy being friends with for so long and then you want to talk to them, but you can't or you don't, for some reason and it's just really weird because there's this guy and like, I've never actually been in a relationship with him of any kind other than just like, not even really friends, just acquaintances that we talk -- like we -- I guess we're friends, we talk every now and then. And then he moved to a new town which, you know, he lived on the other side of Ohio and now he lives like up north in Indiana, so it's the same distance away. I guess it doesn't even matter 'cause I probably won't ever see him, anyways, but I want to know what is going on in his life and all that other -- all that kind of stuff and it's just weird because like, I don't even know him that well, but for some reason I still, like, care about him. I -- I don't even know why, it's just like -- have you ever felt that way where you just care about someone, but you don't know why. And -- so I just want to catch up with him and I don't even really know him. It's just really weird, it's really weird. 
Also, if you haven't heard Adam Lambert's like, new CD like all of it, you need to go check it out because I have never been so obsessed with a CD, other than Lady Gaga because she's just, you know, she's Lady Gaga. But other than Lady Gaga, I've never liked an album as much as Adam Lambert's new album and it's just so good. Like, it has so many good songs on it. I think my favorite is If I had you or Pick You Up, because those are really up beat and I don't know, they're fun to walk too, 'cause I walk to my friends like, every day and I don't know they're really fun. 
All right, I think I'm done rambling about all these different things for now. Um, I'm going to leave with a question which is, um, it's do you believe in God or whatever, the universe or whatever. If you had a choice to die or to go to heaven right now, or stay alive and experience the rest of your life, what would you do? 
All right, thanks for watching, guys. Um, follow me on Twitter and Tumbler and all that stuff. So, . 
Um, thanks for watching, thanks for subscribing, thanks for reading and all that other stuff that you guys do so well and thank you, and thank you and thank you to a Gay Day for letting me fill in for them and getting me so many subscribers. Um, yeah. I'm going to head on and work on the homework again. Night guys, bye.
