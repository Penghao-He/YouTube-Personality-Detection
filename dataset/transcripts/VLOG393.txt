Hey there, folks. This is the creepy disembodied head of Tokyokuni with a brief message that does not apply -- I'm sadly to say -- to the mul -- wide majority of my subscribers. Uh, this is only for those who are in Japan or are going to be in Japan by, well, this Saturday. There's kind of an impromptu, uh, YouTube Tokyo gathering happening at in this Saturday the fifteenth. If you happen to be in town come on by, we'd love to have you. I am not, uh, this event, I'm not in charge of this thing. Kim Tinakov , who some of you may know, is. And I will put, uh, links on the side there connecting to information, uh -- his videos explaining where to go and what to do and what to bring and how to be and all that. Um, but I'm just sending out a friendly invite to anybody out there who wants to come along. Uh, if you'd like to meet and greet and shake hands and share a beer or whatever, come on down. Hopefully we'll see you there. And also just on a side note, I'm sorry the videos have been slow over the last few months. I think I'm back in my groove now. Uh, but then again promises, promises and I could always break my promises to you guys. So sorry. Thank you though for sticking with me, and thank you so much for all the comments and everything. It -- it -- thank you. It's the only reason I'm still doing this after three years. And for those of you who can be there, comment to me in person at the party this Saturday and I will comment back to you and that could become an actual conversation which is -- which is a weird crazy thing we used to have in the old days before, you know, little places to type text underneath people's heads existed. Okay. That's it for me. See you Saturday. Bye.
