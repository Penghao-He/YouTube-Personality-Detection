Hey guys, sorry it's been so long since I last posted a video. I really got caught up in, basically, school. I mean, how cliché is that? Everybody's caught up in school right now. I noticed that a lot of users -- users, ha -- no, people who make YouTube videos -- um, they stop making videos for a few weeks when the school year starts. So, hopefully, you know, people haven't been wondering where I was and thinking that I wasn't gonna come back. But, I'm back, and I'm really going to try and start making videos more consistently. It was just during the summer that I had a lot of time to, uh, waste -- not that YouTube's wasting my time, ha. 
So, basically I've been doing school, taking a sewing class at this art school I go to. And it's really cool, it's a little bit overwhelming 'cause I've never really used a machine before, and I'm just like - rrr, pch, pch, pch. I really want to do fashion design as my future, and I figured okay, well maybe I should sew so that I know what I'm doing. obviously. 
I was really bored one night and I just took a scissors to the face -- head -- region. I kinda wanted a whole Betty Page look -- you know, like, forties pinup. So, hopefully that's what comes across, because I just want to look like a calendar girl bimbo all the time. And there's so many times where I was like, I should make a video. I'm like, well, I'll just read this book. I was reading this book called Shiver. I don't know if anybody else has read it. If you have, leave me a comment telling me what you thought of it, because I was kind of half and half with it, 'cause it's a Stephanie Meyer ripoff with the whole werewolf, true love thing. Umm, it was kind of Jacobish ey, and then kind of an Edward thing mixed in, like I can’t love you 'cause you're a werewolf, vampire, and we can't be together. It was like, we'll find a way. Oh, low battery -- crapface. I'm just gonna stop it here and then -- so this is Shiver. 
Um, if I was going love hate society ratings, I would probably rate a three -- maybe like three and a half, 'cause it definitely was inspired by Twilight and, 'cause the whole werewolf vampire obsession thing really wasn't so romantic before, 'cause the whole idea of falling in love with a werewolf was never quite that appealing until Twilight came along. 
I made the mistake of trying to make these freaking pompom things -- I hate them. Like, oh gosh, if anybody knows how to make these, then please give me the most dumbed down directions that you can possibly ever give a person, because I can't understand directions for crap. I ended rolling this whole thing and then cutting it, and the the whole thing just fell apart after -- after I've been rolling this yarn for about, err, two hours -- yeah, two hours. And then the whole thing just fell apart, so I kind of like cried and screamed and stomped around the house and um, physically abused the sock -- it's got some dents. Uh, that's how I deal with my rage, eh. 
I started watching America's Next Top Model. And I started watching it, and I was shocked, 'cause this is Season -- or Cycle -- thirteen, and it's for short people. And I have nothing against short people. I think that short people are beautiful, um, just as beautiful as someone who is tall. Sometimes short people are prettier than tall people. But, for real, like, it's just -- sorry, you can't really be a model if you're really short. It just doesn't happen. 
And it kind of made the show even lamer than it already is, 'cause Tyra is just such a freak now. Like, I -- I think Tyra Banks is really nice and stuff, but every show she just gets weirder and weirder. Like, what was it, the first episode? She was talking in a French accent half of the time, and one season before, I know that she was dressed up like a princess and she put on a skit with the Mister and Misses Jays or whatever they are. And they were like Prince Charming and Miss Jay was a witch or something. It was the weirdest thing, and I was just like -- wow, this show is really desperate. Um, and then there was a space themed one. It was -- it's getting really weird and over the top. I'm gonna to cry right now. I'm really sad. Meh, what do you think of my fringe? A lot of people don't think I look the same, but you know, hey, I'm the same. Because every single subscriber means so much to me. 
So, um, yeah, oh and the XXXX Channel -- um, I feel horrible about that too. The XXXX Channel really hasn't been -- it's on hiatus, basically. XXXX like quit and then we all decided to take a break, and then XXXX was gonna come back when we're all done with the break. And it's been a while, and we we're gonna make a video saying that we're going on break, but that never happened. And we're just all very scattered and -- I don't know, I think that we'll work out, but we're not really sweating it right now 'cause we really don't want to be, like, you know, uff, Collab Channel nazis. And um, we're just gonna chill for a while, and maybe during Christmas break or -- or something -- we'll start making videos again. 
But I really hope that nobody unsubscribes, because it is a really good channel and I think that we have a lot potential. But we're all a bunch of teenagers who still go to high school and have kind of crazy lives. So, um, hang in there with us, and we'll be posting videos, um, when we're all finally settled down. So yeah, thank you for watching this really long video. I hope that you didn't die of boredom. But yeah, I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.
