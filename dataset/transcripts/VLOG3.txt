Hey there, if you are watching this movie you probably all ready know what Circle Lens are. For those of you that don't I will just let you know really quick. Um, Circle Lens is a type of contact lens, um, that make your iris appear larger. So they're really good for cross playing or giving a dolly effect. They also help with helping make somebody look, like, more awake. 
And, um, they're colored lens usually. They come in, like, black, brown, but like, green, blue, all different colors. They're really good for people who have dark eyes because they're made -- usually they're made in Korea or Japan and, um, they're made so the colors will show very vibrantly on dark eyes. 
Right now I'm actually wearing a pair of Circle Lens. I'm wearing the Geo Nudy in violet. Um, they probably don't look that great because the light's not that great. 
Anyway, um, the point of this video is to let you guys know about a website that sells the Geo Brand Circle Lens for a really good price. Um, the website is called geocirclelens. web. com and all of the lenses on the site range from sixteen dollars to eighteen dollars. The is only five dollars so that is really good. 
The, um, girl who runs the site also does a bunch of promotions. Like, if you buy five pairs you get one free but you don't have to buy them all in one purchase, she will keep track of them for you. Um, she caries different kinds, she does back orders and she also carries in stock lenses so those will get to you within two to five days. 
Um, she carries the Nudy, the Angel, The Magic, the Piercing, any kind of lens that you might need. Um, also she responds to e mails really quickly, so, I'll put a link for the website and her e mail in the sidebar. 
Um, so if you have any more questions just ask her. All right, bye. I thought you're giving me cue, oh, wow, hey there. I just -- whatever we'll just keep going, Circle lens --
