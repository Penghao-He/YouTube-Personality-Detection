So, this would be attempt number three for this evening, which looks like six when I do it this way, but really it's, like, emphasis on three. I had recorded once -- the one time before. I decided to give it a whirl a second time to see if I liked it better. I didn't, I decided on the first one, but apparently that was too long for YouTube, which I didn't find out until after it was, like, you know, converted and uploaded and viewed. 
So, now you see me after, you know, I've removed my makeup and my jewelry and stuff, so hi. And I've done some weird stuff to my hair which you won't get to see because that was in the other video, but uh, I'm gonna do some more weird things because I'm deciding to go with a different, you know, vibe entirely. 
This one's gonna be about knitting this hat. So, um, let's start with the first one. So when you get ready to knit, they usually tell you you have to swatch stuff which is more important when you're making a garment, like, you know, sweater, or something to wear, like, a skirt I guess. There are a lot of garments you can make. I haven't made them 'cause I stick with hats and scarves, 'cause they're small projects. And get done quickly and I'm satisfied with that. 
So uh, anyway, there was this hat pattern at, um -- I'm sleeping, don't mind me -- um, there was this hat pattern at Knitty's. com that I decided I wanted to try and so I didn't have the appropriate needle size so I figured well, I'll just go up one, it shouldn't be a big deal because I knit pretty tight most of the time anyway, which some of you who have gotten hats can probably attest to, right? Uh, anyway, so I went up in needle size, and -- and I didn't swatch, and I decided to make a large pattern version too and a hat that is supposed to pretty fitted for, you know, like, fitted around here, turned out like this. So, um, yeah, swatching, not always a bad thing, even for hats. 
And let's see, which one of these is the right one? Okay, so then there was this other one, this other pattern at Knitty's that I wanted to try 'cause it looked kinda cool, and it's also a hat, and uh, sometimes patterns are wrong. There was a misprint and there's a particular -- if you'll note, see these triangly sections here? Like, this one in the middle right here? That's -- that's a single patterny thing. I'm not sure how to describe it and a I'm doing a horrible job of it, but you repeat this a certain number of times in order to complete the hat. 
Well, the directions called for completing the first one and then doing it four more times. Well, when you do it four more times, this is what you get. And see, like this -- there's room in here, and technically that's supposed to be flipped up, so it looks like that but still -- see? Wide. So, I figured this out. 
I have been debating a weird point. My mom had wanted me to make a hat for her dad that was similar, only different colors and so they were trying to figure out like what the problem was. Like, did I need to go down a needle size? Had I knit too loosely, which is -- would be a new problem -- was a possibility, so I finally figured out that it was probably supposed to be a total repeat of four and not like, five, which is what that one was. 
So I tried it again and it's much better, and also appropriate. Ta da. But you know, apparently when it's looking too big on the needles that might be a good time to check for sure, which is kinda hard to tell 'cause that was straight knitting, like on straight needles, and then cleaning it up. I hate cleaning stuff up, by the way. But it's necessary for it to align. 
Also, side note. This is -- this is not gonna mean much probably to most of you if you don't knit, but um -- and now I'm trying to remember what this is called actually. Short rows, that's right. So these are achieved by very short rows. 
Well the first time I heard about short rows was in conjunction with um, it was like a lingerie pattern, and so it was making a bust line. Which is kinda like, you know, it was like three per cup more or less, but you know, for girls to go into. So the entire time I'm knitting, I feel like, you know, I'm in fifth grade because I snicker every so often thinking about the possibility that in reality -- cause when you around the needles, they kinda go out a little, like, kinda like -- oh, that's hard to tell. Anyway, kinda like that. I keep thinking of seeing the, you know, short rows being done and it's in order to create a cup to create for a bust and so -- so I'm totally immature. Snickering away while I'm knitting and you know, I'm sure if anyone was around, would've been looking at me peculiar -- oddly. Anyway, so that was my knitting gone wrong. 
I haven't actually done much knitting since then. I've got, like, a scarf on the needles right now. That's a secret thing that I need to get back to but it's so tedious 'cause it's, like, it's -- it's smaller than I'm used to. It's on size eight. Again, probably doesn't mean much to most of you and some of you are probably going nuts not because if you've seen some of the socks -- I've yet to make to make a sock and I'm going to stop talking about knitting now, because no one is interested. 
Instead, since I've had to move stuff to get the laptop set up where it was at on my bed, that means my sunglasses were there. So these are actually the ones I wear most of the time, not the blue ones in the previous, you know, video. And these actually -- 'cause look at the size of this piece, right? That's pretty big. It won't fit in my purse, without removing a lot of other stuff from it. 
If I wear these out, they usually wind up on my head, if I'm, like, you know, going in somewhere where I don't want to wear them, 'cause they're not really see through, they're kinda -- well, they're see through 'cause they're sunglasses, duh, but they're -- they're kinda dark, so um, wearing them into retail locations and such is not always a good idea. So they -- they usually live up here when they're not in my case, but um, I'm not sure how energy this is turning up to be. I must admit I'm a wee bit sleepy. Not really sleepy sleepy but I'm kinda -- I can be more up. And I had to have caffeine today to function. 
Speaking of which, you'll have likely read about the whole trip to Penney's yeah, already so -- I was told yesterday that I had to be ready to leave at one thirty, and we weren't going to be leaving 'til two, but I had to be out of the bathroom by one thirty, which usually takes me an hour to get all set and done in there, 'cause I'm a girl or something. I am a girl, I'm not something, I'm a girl, right. 
So anyway, I had -- I had been awoken or woken up at uh, about -- well, earlier this morning than I wanted to get up. I'm not going to tell you what time, 'cause it's pretty sad. Anyway, there was the industrial size riding lawnmower outside my window. There's a quiet thick expanse of grass out here, outside my window, and because it stretches on, for you know, quite you can tell with the slides here because I'm indicating my window so that you can see -- windows to my span, fun right? So there's a lot of grass out there. 
And uh, the mowing went on for forty five minutes before I could hear it, and I tried to go back to sleep and it didn't really work, until, like, you know, closer to the time where I needed to get up, which obviously, now that I've told you I had to be ready by one thirty, and it takes me an hour, you're guessing right, that I had to be up by at least twelve thirty to go in the shower, which I was up sooner than that because I had to get up, you know, and do some other stuff, but, anyway. So, I eventually fell back asleep and got about thirty minutes in, and woke up later than I had been planning, but it worked out more or less. 
Anyway, I had gotten sufficiently less sleep than I had planned on. I had gotten about an hour less than I had desired, so um, which when I'm sleeping about six hours anyway, I -- I need that, you know. Five -- five is kinda pushing it for functioning really well. Six, I can manage to swing, so I had gotten around five hours of sleep, and um, I didn't allot enough time to go pick up coffee, so I ended up with coffee from Dunkin' Donuts with two shots of espresso in it. At least they're doing espresso now, it helps save it some, but I'm admittedly a coffee snob and that was not my favoritest cup of coffee ever, so now I know. 
I allot extra time to go get coffee, 'cause I don't drink it often enough to have a supply at home, so I have to go procure it elsewhere. And I think I'm going to wrap this up now, 'cause this is getting longer than it needs to be and I'm not sure if I can, you know, assure quality control, so. 
Yeah, if you have a quest, leave them, I'll try to get to everything in the next one, 'cause I know I've missed some stuff from the previous one and back and forth. 
So, I love you all.
