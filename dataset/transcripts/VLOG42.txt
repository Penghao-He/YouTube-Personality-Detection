I think it's time for another haircut. Hey folks, um, if you all remember way back in two thousand seven, we did a Christmas collaboration together that I thought was rather fun and I'll throw in a little clip of the beginning of that video if I can download it and add it in here. But I just thought I would put out the request; anybody that is interested in doing a Christmas collaboration video this year, send me a clip. You can send it to me XXXX and I will include your clip in a large collaboration. 
It doesn’t really matter how long the clip is. The shorter you keep them, the more I will be able to put into the collaboration, so if you make it just a quick merry Christmas wish or you want to sing a song or whatever you want to do. Christmas is a time to celebrate friends and family as far as I'm concerned. And friends are the family that you choose, at least that's the way I look at it, and I have lots of family here on YouTube. 
So if you want to be involved, send me a clip. If it's a relatively small clip, you can send it straight to my email, XXXX, or send it via yousendit dot com and it will get it to me. That way I can go download the larger clips from there. Do it high def if you can, if not no big deal, and we'll just put it all together and have a good time. 
So put on your thinking caps. Put on your Christmas season caps. Fill your hearts with Christmas joy and season's greetings and see what you can come up with, and we'll see what we put together. 
So looking forward to doing it again this year; so send them on.
