What's up, you guys? Um, normally I would post two videos in the same day, but I feel, like, what I have to say is extremely important enough for me to do so. 
So um, I was just presented with a situation, and before I even start this, this is going straight to the person who caused me to actually want to make a video about it, because I realized that whenever someone is not sure about something or kind of in the blind, or in the dark about a situation, they come off sounding more stupid than they really are. So, it's no shame, um, even if they comment -- anyway. 
Okay, a girl added me today on MySpace and I had this thing on my page where you can contact me via MyS -- I mean via Yahoo, and she aksed me was I gay, right off the bat. She asked me if I was bisexual, to be more correct about the situation. And I was, like, no I'm gay. She paid it and she was, like, well it's been -- what it was, like, while it lasted blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
And you know, being gay, you gonna -- you expect stuff like that, so I really paid it 'cause I'm not interested in you anyway. So girl, it -- it doesn't matter to me. Um, but then she came back, here recent -- just a while ago. And she was, like, uh, I don't mean to bother you but I just wanted to know if being gay come natural or was there a error that had been -- while you were growing up. 
Now, I'm -- I -- I'll answer that question on almost -- of occasion, but it just pisses me off that every time someone brings up a situation about someone being gay, it's always talked to some kind of negative aspect in a person's life. Like, how the hell -- I mean not how, but why the hell does being gay have to be tied to so many negative feeling? Actually being straight isn't all a walk in the park either. 
Um, being part of a community and then being part of a sub community: one me being a African American male, and then two for me being a homosexual African American male, it kinda puts me in a tough position because I really want to act immaturely and go off whenever I -- I receive statements like that, but honestly, I think that the best way to prove a point to someone is just to continue doing yourself, and do it maturely. 
Um, it's obvious and that it was just made clear to me that there's a lot of people in the dark about being homosexual. But, um, and it kind -- the conversation ended up stopping because she didn't like one of my -- my answers and honestly I didn't even go off on the girl, but I -- I don't know. 
Barak Obama isn't the only one who can inspire change, and I'm definitely gonna start making my walk about change, because if a person -- if this, people are still left in the dark about being a homosexual, what homosexual people go through or how its come about, then obviously we need to do more as a whole to give that situation -- talk about and discuss more thoroughly. 
Man, this pr -- this video probably won't even hit home to a lot of people, specially to those who don't put much thought into -- into it. But I just feel like I needed to, um, say my little spill on it, and there's so much more that I could say about it, but I'm not even gonna waste anyone's time. 
Tomorrow is a day of thanks, and we should all be blessed and thankful that we are alive, breathing and kicking -- some of us well, but some of not. But we're still here making it and struggling. So, I don't know. I'm just gonna be thankful for that, and I'm going to definitely create a video tomorrow to which I'll leak after Happy Thanksgiving even though I probably get into many of you already, but um, still, just because. But, y'all be careful and y'all take care. And just, uh, discuss -- discuss the things that people aren't necessarily discussing. 
Be different. Make a change. Peace.
