Hello, I'm back again, after a week or so, I'd say roughly a week. And I'm going to do one of those really cool, specialty videos, because I really don't want to talk about nothing again. I'm going to do one of those fifty thing videos, you know, show people 50 things around you, because people really wanna see what you have in your house. I don't know. So I'm going to do it because I'm cool and trendy. Well I'm not trendy; I make my own trends. Anyway, just watch. 
This is a bag of bagels. I painted this dog. It's a bra. I am Jack's first girlfriend. A clip notebook party plan. . I was in eighth grade. I'm strip. Oh yeah, bitches. Rest in peace, Kim. I don't think we can live without peace. And I'm done. Bye.
