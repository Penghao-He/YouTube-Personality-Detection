It's really difficult doing this particular part of a blog where I am trying to talk about the economic crisis and me and, um, my story. I have recorded this a number of times. Um, I stumble over myself, and so, here we go again. Um, you know, when it comes to the economy and me and my story, you know, I don't think mine is really a whole lot different than millions of other people, because really and truly this current economic crisis, which, you know, we kind of recognize began, um, two thousand and seven, um, started for many of us though, really about ten years ago, with the tech telecom crash. 
Um, so in my case it actually was the year two thousand when I lost a twenty eight year career. Um, and it was without any buyouts, uh, pension, any benefits or anything like that. It was just, uh --'cause not everyone got all of those kinds of things, which I think is a huge misunderstanding across this country that, uh, you know -- there is a huge sort of have and have not of a group of people when they do, uh, leave companies. So, uh, I managed to sort of, kind of, gather myself together and regroup from then, and it was, you know -- it was not, uh, totally unexpected, and I continued on. But the thing was that, you know, what, uh, that didn't -- didn't -- that didn't do to me, um, was changed on September eleventh, two thousand and one, when, uh, that event affected my partner, uh, financially. So there was kind of a double wammy there. And we were still doing quite well. I cannot say that, uh, things were bad for us. Uh, we definitely had taken some financial hits on, you know, retirements and things like that. 
So we quickly knew and had to start changing our thinking on the way that we lived and how that we spent money. And, uh, neither one of us really have ever been, uh, in debt or, uh, use debt much. Um, so, um, cost cutting, things like that, which in a lot of ways, honestly, was inherently in our nature. Um, it just seemed kind of crazy though because, uh, we were working as hard as we ever were, um, in fact, even more so, and, uh, we were making, you know, decent money -- not great money. And I know that, uh, we knew that people that were around us were making about the same money, but somehow they seemed to be doing so much better with a lot of the material, consumer goods and all that kind of stuff, and, uh --
And so that was a very interesting awakening, uh, in the consciousness about, you know, how Americans are, and how we have become the country consumers. And you know we just begin to learn to live, sort of, with that, and not be a part of it, I suppose. 
Um, however, that doesn't mean that this last economic crisis, uh, in two thousand and seven didn't impact us, uh, me in particular, particularly hard, because, um, I've been lost, uh, the second, uh, job that I had -- uh, had for a long time. And, um, you know, it's been difficult, uh, more -- but we were fairly well prepared for all of that stuff and have been holding our own, keeping our head above water, and, um, that's still the way it is now. But this cannot go on. So it really is all about, um, continuing to look for those multiple streams of income that you know are small, but you know they do contribute to things. Um, and, um, looking at the whole way of, uh, employment and income and jobs entirely differently, um, and approaching it from a whole different way in -- so that -- in order to be able to accept that there is a new world. This is a new way of doing things. It's not going back to the way they were, even if there is a recession technically called over. 
The rebuilding period is going to be a very different thing for so many of us. Um, and it is really about how we adapt to that. And it's fluid. It's ever evolving. It's constantly changing, and that's the key thing, is knowing that it's shifting ground and that we are operating on shifting ground, and if we can keep that in mind and still keep our heads together, we've got at least some chance.
