Hey, internet. It's Wednesday, December second two thousand and nine and man it's not a good day for the gays, no parades today. That's because the New York Senate smacked down the legalization of gay marriage with a thirty eight to twenty four vote. And this vote, among many things, makes me realize we're just waiting for the old and ignorant to die like Strom Thurmond, God bless his racist motherfucking soul because when a representative in Washington is also the same guy that filibustered four segregations, you just have to wonder, when are you going to die? 
And I know gays are scary to lots of people. All fire and brimstone and assless chaps. The gays are awesome. If not for the gays, we wouldn't have the Village People, the Bravo Network, sodomy. And sodomy is so popular with everyone, even the Catholic Church picked it up but with their own little twist on it. 
If you're Catholic and offended by that, shut up, I was raised as Catholic. From the age of two we're told feel guilty about everything. My mother would always quote, I would rather you see the good womb of a whore than on the ground. Where the hell is that? 
And there are three reasons I had to leave the Catholic religion. One, Catholicism is anti masturbation. Two, can't masturbate, but you're also not allowed to use birth control. And three, they don't believe dogs go to heaven. That's a lie. That shit was even in a movie. 
But it's funny that we're actually talking about the Catholic Church because the Catholic Church is in the news because of a new PETA ad. Oh, my God my two favorite things. The new ad involves Joanna Crupper . Don't know who she is, doesn't matter because Joanne is completely naked with a cross in a church surrounded by puppies, not even joking. I can't show you the full picture, not even because I would be flagged. So much blood would instantly leave your brain to go elsewhere, you would die, and I don't need that on my chest. 
Not surprisingly the church has a problem with this, seeing that PETA has a history of exploiting Jewish and Catholic themes. Joanna Crupper responded that she was shocked that the Catholic Church was against her ads and she's doing God's work by defending the defenseless animals. I'd have to side with PETA on this one, mainly because I like naked girls and masturbation. Two things Catholicism has shown me that they are not big fans of. 
But back to the gays. For some reason they just scare people even in the new video game, Dragon Edge there's a scene where your character can engage another guy. If you select the right options you can have gay sex and there's this is weird steamy cut scene and not surprisingly, someone's going to have a problem with it. Not only are those video games making our kids violent, they're turning them into homosexuals. But the next generation of children will be, like, motherfucker, I said floor print motherfucker; I'm a pop your ass. Seriously there are a ton of websites on the internet that believe there is a conspiracy to turn the children gay. What motive, I don't know. We'll turn everyone gay then they'll realize no one can get married and then that's when they'll legalize gay marriage, it's all part of our evil gay plan. 
Now where's my body gooder, I have to go and do some young sexual boys and turn them gay. If we're being completely honest, marriage isn't the holiest of holies anymore. I mean, the only difference between marriage back then and marriage now is the progression of woman's rapes and the invention of the prenup. That's why there are so many divorces these days. There's no reason to stay in a loveless marriage. 
And that makes me want to go back to Tiger Woods. He's been getting drugged through the mud this week, the voice mail audio is released to the internet of Tiger Woods telling his mistress to change her information because his wife may call. And Tiger Woods apologized to everyone on his website. As of today, a third woman has come to light to say she had an affair with Tiger Woods. Her name? Don't know. Let's call her vagina number three. I'm wondering when are these woman going to stop coming out? How many holes did Tiger play? 
But the main question of this video is shouldn't gay people have the rights and the chance to live in a loveless marriage, to have and to hold, to resent and regret for as long as they shall live? I think so. 
But guys that's just my opinion and I know I'll be inviting a lot of heat in with this question. But what's your stance on New York slapping down on legalization of gay marriage? It's the question of the day. Guys, that's all that matters to me this Wednesday. 
My name's XXXX and you've just been filled in.
