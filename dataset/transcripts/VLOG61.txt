Well, got an interesting email the other day. Why do I make videos that are so graphic, violent, always talking about death and everything else? It's real simple. I sort of hope this answers your question, if not I don't know what to tell you. 
It's called my disorder. That's what goes through my head. That's how I can express how I feel and what I'm really thinking. And so, it just happens to bleed out on YouTube. If you don't like it, don't watch it. I don't care, because this is for me; not anybody else. If it helps other people to understand more about my disorder, great; I love it. But if it offends you or if it's not PC, whatever, get the fuck off my page. 
I am sick and tired of dealing with bullshit of other people who get easily offended. Oh my God, it's not politically correct. Oh my God, that is just too graphic. I don't care. Like I said, it's for me. If other people can get something out of it, cool. So, you know, you're on YouTube. Okay, YouTube is not exactly known for polit -- politically correctness. This is a place where people can freely express themselves through video. I'm -- I'm -- sorry. I'm just really, really frustrated with people who email me saying that, oh my God it's so detrimental to the young people. 
Damn it, young people shouldn't be seeing this shit. The young people should not be on the internet unsupervised. So, you know, if they get traumatized by this, not my fault. That would be the parent's fault who's supposed to be supervising their children while they're on the internet. Because, you know, then they'll run across a porn site -- what are you gonna do, blame the porn site? I don't know. All right. I hope that answers people's questions about why my videos are always graphic; are always violent or whatever. And please continue to view, because, you know, I really do think people can get something out of what comes out of my head. 
So, take care, have a good evening, weekend or what -- wherever you're at. Take care.
