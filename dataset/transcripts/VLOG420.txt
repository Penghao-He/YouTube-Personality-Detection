Hi guys, I thought I would make this video using this camera today seeing as I can't be bothered to turn on my laptop. But I thought I'd get cracking on the whole Lee Evans video because I know one of my subscribers wanted me to make it. So I'm going to talk about Lee Evans and Michael Macintyre. 
Well, you're probably going to find it weird but I've never really heard of Lee Evans before my subscriber actually mentioned it to me, I was like who the hell is he? She was like, he's a comedian. I've seen him on TV and been at my friend's house, because she's got a video of him, like, you know, videos and I've been watching him and he's really funny. I mean obviously, he's a comedian. Yes, I didn't realize he's was that funny. I think he's good, I think he's a good comedian, yes, cool. 
He really sweats a lot, a big turn off. I don't know why he sweats that much. My personal favorite comedian, Michael Macintyre, who I think is brilliant, I think he's amazing, I love -- he's a funny guy. I think he's really funny as well as Lee Evans because they're comedians really, I don't know. But Michael Macintyre's my personal favorite. I think Lee Evans is very good comedian as well though. Is it just me or does anyone else think the same. 
I don't know if you've seen the East Indian's theme like, when it kind of does a circle bit around London, like EOT , does like a circle bit and then the titles come up. Have you noticed that they've actually changed the blinking - the whole sequence. I don't like it. It like comes up through the clouds. It's really crap. It looks so fake. Some of you might think it looks really good. You know, it's nice and colorful, but I think it is fake, well it is fake. It just looks so crap. 
Do you know those adverts that you get that are like, about the whole text love and your partner -- see how long the relationship lasts? They've got this advert where this girl, she's like sitting, crying outside the church with her wedding dress on, going . That was so bad, sorry. She was just -and it said, she didn't listen - she texted her partner's name and her name to eight hundred or whatever and the love match was crapped or something. She didn't listen and carried on with her relationship as if everything was normal and fine which she obviously thought it was. But then at the end of the relationship, on her wedding day, he left her. I mean, as if that's going to happen in real life. I hate when they do this, grab your money, oh my, that relationship is not going to last.

So I'm going to that. I didn't even plan what I was going to do this weekend, but I just heard about it a couple of days ago so I thought, yes, I'm going to that. 
You know that new movie, Street Dance? The one who , well they're looking for extras, so I applied and I'm going to go there on the nineteenth to do whatever, be one of the crowd or something. I'm looking forward -- I'm pumped up for that.
