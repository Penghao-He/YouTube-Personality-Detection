Why am I making this? I bought one of these hot chocolate things where it's cold and then you crack it and then it shakes up back in my pound. Got nothing to really say in this video. I don't even know why I'm making it. 
I'm back to staring at the screen instead of at the lens as well, good times. I bought biscuit toast, but it's just stale bread, there is no biscuit and no toast involved. It's a lie.
