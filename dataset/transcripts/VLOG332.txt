Hey guys, it's me XXXX. I know I -- I think I said in my last video I was going to shave off my mustache, but somebody commented on it saying it looked like the anti Hitler, because Hitler had the, um, hair in the middle and on my hair -- I have no hair here at all. It seems to be curling out the side like this, so I decided to keep it, you know, for a couple more weeks or so though I'd shave it off. Because if I shave it off I look a lot younger and I'm twenty one and I want to look as young as possible, you know? 
Um, so yeah, uh, basically -- oh, I got one more thing before I start on my actual topic that I'm going to do today. I think Adam Lambert got robbed on American Idol. He should've won. It should've been Danny and Adam in the bottom -- I mean in the top two, bottom two. Should've been Danny and Adam in the top two with Adam winning or even if Danny won, it would've seemed more realistic than Kris Allen winning. I think Kris Allen is a little bit -- gonna get my shirt words on it. Uh, I think Kris Allen's not that good of a performer. He doesn't really live to the name of an American Idol. Neither does Taylor Hicks, season five. I thought he was just like, you know, one of the joke kind of contestants like Sanjaya was in season six. And I can't think of any other ones offhand, but you know what I mean. 
Um, yeah, so anyways I work at Taco Bell and I've worked there for about a year and a half now and strangely enough I enjoy working there. I know it seems strange like, oh my God, someone actually works -- likes working for a fast food? Well, yes I do, I enjoy it and -- 'cause really it's not just the whole job aspect that I enjoy, I actually like the people I work with. They're so laid back and they're so, you know, accepting of me as a person as well as, you know, my situations -- that I had been put in situations that I have that I will discuss later on with you guys. 
And my boss is very lenient with my schedule and understands all my situations pretty well and I'm thankful for that and you know, a job is a job no matter what. You should be thankful that you even have a job no matter how low in the food chain that job is. And I get a paycheck every two weeks and I'm fine. I mean, I can survive on what I get. I can make it work. 
And -- oh, and you're probably all wondering the background, like you have a Coca Cola room? Trust me, it's not my idea, I swear, but I'll go into why my room is like this in another video. 
Anyways, back on topic. Um, so yeah, I like my job 'cause it's actually -- and there's a lot of diverse people at the Taco Bell that I work at. Mexican people, black people, gay people, me, a couple of people are bisexuals there. Um, men, women, children -- well, not children, minors, you know. Old, young, middle age. 
And even have our own little pet ducks at work too. So I know it seems kinda odd, but my boss takes care of the ducks outside of the drive thru and we use all the food that we don't need -- all the -- anything that's dried up or old, we just, you know, tear up. We put it in a thing called a duck box and we set the duck box outside and the little ducks come and eat their uh, eat the food. 
So, yeah, it's kinda cool and I think I'm very lucky to have the job that I have with the people that I work with, 'cause the people that I work with are probably one in a million. The crew is probably one in a million chance that I would work with them because they're so funny and nice and -- and -- and, you know, team -- huge team players. Yeah, we all make mistakes but, you know, who doesn't make mistakes? 
I mean, it's just a great place. It's a great environment and I -- that's surprising considering I live in California, but I'm not going to get into that. I like California, I do, but certain places in it scare me to death so that's why I don't travel that much anywhere in California. I practically stay in Stockton here most of the time. 
Um, so yeah, that's about it, that's about what I do. You're probably thinking, oh God, this blog is kinda boring -- I'm -- well, I promise you, once I get all the personal stuff about myself -- personal stuff about myself out of the way, then I'll start diving into some of the other topics like how I came out. 
That's probably really juicy, that's a funny story about how I came out and why I came out and who I came out to and what was the background behind that and, you know? It was really funny. It's actually kinda work related too, so, yeah. 
So guys, I hope you guys have a good summer 'cause school's out amongst other things. I'm out, school's out, I came out saying here schools' out. See how that works? 
I know that's kind boring, whoop dee doo. Anyways, um, so I hope to see you guys later, maybe in a couple of days. 
I wanna try to do these blogs as frequently as I possibly can. I've just been really really busy with work. But now that everyone is out of school, I should be able to do these at least once or twice a week and I -- trust me, I'll have subjects galore for these blogs and um, I hope you guys will subscribe and follow me -- that's twitter, something different, huh? 
Anyways, yeah, in the description box, this way -- no this way, right? No, this way. I couldn't remember, it's sorta like a mirror image so I'm pointing the wrong way. In the description box on this side, over here, this way -- I don't know how to do that right then, um, you'll find the link to my MySpace, so if you want to, friend request me on MySpace, go ahead, post a comment, do whatever you want. 
Uh, yeah so that's about it for this blog for today. Ciao.
