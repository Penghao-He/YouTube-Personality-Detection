It's been a bit of a while. Um, yeah. I almost didn't film this because I looked at my face and said, Mary , your eyebrows are out of control and you haven't put any makeup on for weeks. Why? It's isn't true -- no, it is true. 
You might be able to hear a leaf blower outside. I keep looking at myself -- it's been a while. Okay, I'm gonna quickly do this before my computer goes way too hot -- hachoo, hachoo, hachoo. These are computer noises. Oh, you can see a man. 
Hi. So I recorded this vlog and then my computer crashed. Yay, technology. I'm so happy about it. Ah! So I decided just to do it all over again because I went off on this tangent about things that I realized I -- it isn't that I shouldn't be talking about them, it's just like, why am I talking about them? Why? Why? Why? Sorry, I was just -- yeah. Anyhow. 
So, uh, I've been busy working, as I do. If you follow me on Twitter -- and you should -- then you, you know, read a lot of tweets about, like, sitting in the street, and I'm painting shoes, and I'm working on the website, and I'm painting other stuff and bein' artsy as I do. It's my job. Or I just did the shop update or whatever -- whatever I do or, you know, things like I had to pee, pee! 
Um, yes, my roots are back. A month ago I got my hair dyed up again and I had my roots and, uh, my eyebrows look, like, quite insane. So I'm just bringing back the eighties. Yeah. 
Shoes. Do, do, do, do, do. I wanna give you guys music and I figured if I could just make my own music. It should be finished today. Um, anyways -- I should just make my own music with my mouth, then they wouldn't take my video off the YouTubes for copyright infringement. 
Speaking of copyright infringement, this is hilarious and I realize now that I should've grabbed it earlier, but I just thought about it -- about it. Um, about three weeks ago, I got -- maybe it was two weeks ago -- it had to be right about three -- three weeks ago I got a message from a friend of mine. She said, Mary, go to this LiveJournal shop, there's something -- stuff of yours that I don't think you licensed. And I was like, what? That's me, like, going there, I was like, boodaloodle . Uh, so I boodaloodaloodled . 
Uh, my computer is really heating up again. Hold on. Okay. It just got brighter in here. Sorry for all the really bad cuts, I just wanna get through this story, um, and then I'll tell you guys about the sale and I'll leave, because I haven't really got much for an update and I look worse for wear. 
So I went to the shop and saw that they were selling the shirt that did contain my artwork and, uh, was apparently bought at an Australian shop. So I contacted the people at the Australian shop and they said they only bought five of these shirts, uh, at a shop stall in, I think, Bangkok, Thailand. So, um, it's from a company called Happy Hippie be cool T shirt suite. 
So I bought the shirt from a person on, uh, LiveJournal and this is it, and as you can see, it is indeed my work. But it's really bad, you can just -- you can't make it out on here, um, but you can actually see all the pixels and it looks faded but it's just because the ink -- uh, since it was blown up, instead of having it blurred, uh, you know, and all pixel y, uh, you can see through it to the actual shirt material. And the ink is, like, every other pixel. So, yeah. That's the worst quality I've ever seen. But it made me laugh, so there you go. Bootleg a Mary Tanner T shirts. You can get them in Bangkok. It's messed up. 
Um, aside from that fun, I'm trying to think -- I don't know what else has been going on. There's some videos that I wanted to put up. Having a lot of issues with my computer lately. I don't like it. I just got this thing in, like, December. 
Anyhow, so I'm working on shoes. Um, there's a huge shop sale, and the link is over there and it's my Etsy shop. You buy two necklaces, you get one free. You buy two phone trams, you get one free. If you buy two art prints, you get one free. Uh, if you buy two rings, you get one free. And if you live in the US and you spend over thirty dollars, you get free shipping -- and that's thirty dollars before the shipping charges are applied. 
Um, aside from that -- in order to do it you have to actually go through, um, pay for it. So you'd add, like three necklaces and then I'll refund you the money for one of those necklaces because that's the only way I could work it out with PayPal and with Etsy. 
So have fun. There's tons of stuff in the shop. I, uh, have been advertising everywhere I possibly can and I'm gonna go continue to paint. I got a huge shipment of uh, paint and clay and canvas and masonite boards and and I'm very excited to get started in with it, but first I have to do other work and I have to, uh, you know, go wax my eyebrows or something. I don't know, what do ladies do? As if being a lady. 
I like making stupid faces. It's fun -- fun! Oh, also I wanna have a live show eventually again, I just don't know when. And my biggest thing is I don't know uh, how my computer can handle it. Uh, uh, yeah, it really sucks. I freed up a whole bunch of space so I can be faster -- it's not that. I think I just need a different laptop cooler because this one is crap. 
I have weird teeth. My teeth are weird. I'm gonna keep commenting about myself. Any disparaging remarks I say about myself -- it's not so you guys go, no, you're fine. Oh no, no, no, we all look horrible equally. It's fun. I like to be self deprecating, not 'cause I'm fishing for compliments -- I don't want the compliments. It's okay, okay? 
I've missed you guys. I've missed this. I've missed this. This -- it's something I've missed. I've missed it. I've missed it so much that I actually grew these little side pieces out again had a may just go. They're back. They're back. They're back. They're ba -- this is why you watch vlogs, okay? They're back. They're back. Oh, you know what? Um, there are some other things I would like to, um -- go vote for my design at infectious dot com. It's where skate deck -- it's their, uh, pop deck contest. It's really cool. The contest, I mean. 
Uh, what else is over there? I don't know what else is over there. Whatever I put there. Go join the sidebox do do do do do . I'll have more regular vlogs once the website's up again, and then the vlog is okay just in the website itself. Then you can go dot com or you can just continue to subscribe here. Whatever. You'll be right there. 
And I was gonna, uh -- embed, like, WordPress or have my website be WordPress theme and I just wasn't smart enough to do it, and plus I was, like, I just bought Dreamweaver, I might as well use it. So I just went with, like, you know, frames and called it a night. I was gonna say called it a day, but let's face it -- I don't work in no daytime. It looks a lot brighter than it is out there -- it's sunset time. It's sunset time. 
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun lady computer.
