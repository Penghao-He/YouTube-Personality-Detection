Hi. I'm XXXX, and this is XXXX, a blog series where I tell you who my dream celebrity boyfriend is. I tried having real boyfriends for awhile, but it didn't work out. Not because I'm gay; I'm not. But because me and regular, real, boys just don't seem to get along. Like, I'll say, Hey, why don't you let me bring my best friend into bed? And they'll go, Oh, that sounds great. But then when I bring her in, they can't handle it. Her name is XXXX, and we sleep together every night, as friends. 
They also don't like it that I still suck my thumb sometimes. Like, that's such a big deal. Also, I don't perform oral sex. So, I decided, that this week's dream celebrity dream boyfriend is the awesomest  dude ever. He's so cute, he's a rainbow of fruit flavors of different ethnic combinations. He's awesome at sports, and he loves to do it. I give you: Tiger Woods. 
I know what you're thinking. Sarah Benincasa, this has to be some kind of comedy joke. This is wild? Why would you want to be with Tiger Woods? He cheated on his beautiful wife and, make that two, beautiful, multi ethnic babies. He is a jerk. And there I say, Stop. No he isn't. He's a hero. Here's why. Tiger Woods has single handedly proven that Asian dudes can be fuck monsters too. And that's awesome. I mean, when was the last time you saw an Asian American dude venerated in our culture as a super sex symbol? Nev'? I mean, I'm super into Harold from Harold & Kumar, but I doubt the rest of you are, 'cause you're racists. 
I'm not racist, and neither is XXXX. And we think Tiger Woods is great. He's half Asian and he's had sex with, like, all the white women in the whole world, except for me. I hope that Tiger's watching and I want him to know that if he wants to call me, he can. And he can take me out on a date to Outback Steakhouse and we can get a Blooming Onion. I'll eat it and I'll make out with him, but uh uh uh, right after -- and then I'll eat a steak 'cause it's a steakhouse and then I'll dig my tongue in his mouth blalala and it'll be so awesome. 
Tiger, you're the man for me. I love you, and I think that you are a civil rights hero, like Martin Luther King, Jr. or Mario Lopez. This has been this week's edition of Celebrity Dream Boyfriend Dream, and I'm six. I'll see you at three. Bye. Say goodbye, XXXX. Bye.
