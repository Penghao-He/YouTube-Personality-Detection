So it's midnight right now and um, my brother is sleeping right over there, yeah. Okay. I found this Magic Eight Ball too, I love Magic Eight Balls, okay? What do we want to know? Will the Yankees win the World Series next year? Reply hazy try again. Okay, I'm trying again. My sources say no. Damn it. I was really rooting for, um, what's it called, Tampa Bay? They were what's up. Apparently, whatever, whatever, Phillies, whatever. 
I'll be on that kryptonite. Straight up on that kryptonite. I'll be on that, straight up on that, I'll be on that kryptonite. 
I committed a crime I know it's hard to believe, so, I was driving a long and I won't name the dri -- driver. You know, confidentiality and what not and I said stop the car. Okay, open the door quick -- I was in the passenger seat and I just reached out and I grabbed this person's lawn sign and I threw it inside the car. I know I'm so risky, I'm so evil, I'm such a -- just a dare devil. But yeah, it took a long time to vote yes on question one side. Not cool, not cool but the next day there was another one. Whatever. That kinda pissed me off, but whatever. Actually I learned the sign for whatever, I'm taking sign language, whatever. I thought that was a kinda cool sign because I'm trying to teach my self how to sign, um, you can have, like, whatever -- whatever you like. Like TI, you know? You can have whatever you like . 
Yeah. Muah.
