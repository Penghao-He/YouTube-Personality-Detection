This is it, summertime. It hasn't sunk it yet I'm on my holidays -- I was down the shops with my mum and I was like, I should be at the house. And then I thought, no, I shouldn't. It looks like everyone's predictions for Biology came up anyway, funny , though it would have been easier if I'd studied a bit more so it's no one's fault but my own, but they were fine. I was really good, but I was kinda stuck for time at the end -- I was scribbling, scribbling away and drawing and everyone else like finished this week finished today, finish yesterday, finish tomorrow, anyone? What're they gonna do the next year, I'd say, do not worry about it, because everyone, they -- it seems like there's this big hype on it and that, oh my God, it's this terrible thing, but it's really, really not. 
You're sitting there doing it and you're like, is this really ? It's not like it seems at all, and anyone doing it right now will tell you that. I would feel a bit more unstressed if my books weren't still on the floor, and my sheets and everything, and my shoulder's sore, but now it's time to re lax. Uh, how's everyone fixed for German tomorrow? Um, I ask because I've got a few friends doing German so -- ich bin, something, something. Don't forget tomorrow's my last blog, so you'd better get your questions in now because it's now or never. And you know what else is really good? I was complaining 'bout it, but it's been raining and it's been miserable all week, which is good. 
I hope it stays like that until the end of the leaving because do you remember all other years, it would be really, really, sunny, I remember during the Junior , it was really sunny? So leave me a comment everybody, or a video response there. What else is on this -- German tomorrow? I'm really not sure. But um, yeah. Leave me a comment everybody or a video response, and tell me how you're getting on, just ask me anything if you want. And you know yourself, 'kay? Bye.
