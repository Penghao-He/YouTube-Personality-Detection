So you guys, I'm here and I have not forgotten about my channel. And I really want to thank all the new subscribers -- um -- that have subscribed to me since, uh, my last video. And, um, that was about Harvey Milk. 
And I want to make some updates about the news that Iowa has become the third state to legalize gay marriage on Friday on April third -- I think it was April third. And by unanimous vote they ruled a ban on gay marriage as unconstitutional and twenty one days after the ruling, which is April twenty fourth, licenses will be granted to same sex couples to get married. So that is amazing because you know, um, after propate -- I think there's a lot of movement now that, you know, this isn't right, you know, to ban gay marriage or to ban marriage for all -- like a certain group of people is not constitutional. I mean that's like separate but equal but it's not equal you know. So that was amazing that Iowa, out of a lot of states, amazingly, um, is the third state now along with Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
So other than that, um, I've been having a lot of fun. I went to a quinceanera, uh, quince anos which is a Spanish tradition for women of -- of the age of fifteen. It's kind of like a rite of passage -- um uh -- for women to become part of society and -- uh -- start dating and all that stuff. And it's like a birthday but it's like a sweet sixteen in Latin America. So that was pretty cool. I've never been to one and it was my third cousin's quinceanera. Yeah. 
And I went to a club yesterday also after that and it was really cool 'cause it was in the city and -- I haven't really been to clubs, I been more to bars but yeah it's really cool. Partying it up. Yes. And let's see what else. 
Um, I'm giving some shout outs to four channels. Um, one of 'em is, um, my channel that I, um, mostly vlog on because I do like a weekly vlog on the five complete strangers and there's also two, um, let's see -- there's Alex from the UK, there is Sam from Virginia and, um, there's -- what else -- oh -- the Alex from the US, uh, Louisiana, and then, um, then there's me for Thursday and then there's Chris for Friday. And that is the five complete strangers. And we usually have like a weekly theme. Um, so look forward to that. So subscribe to that if you haven't. 
And then there's another channel, um, Manny -- Manny Sole -- Manny. I just call him Manny. He steals my money. And this is a girl that asked me for help, uh, back in January -- like now -- like a week before like I made my video of coming out and, uh, she's great. She's made two videos and I think she's really under -- under hype because I know she's a new vlogger and I think she makes great vlogs and she'll probably make more vlogs if you guys subscribe so, um, I'll post a link in the video right now. Manny My Sole and I hope you guys like her channel. 
And then the other two are the guys from, uh, the five complete strangers, the new guys, which is Chris -- Chris -- anything west of Lincoln and Sam. Sam is crazy, awesome nineteen ninety. Um, so subscribe to those, you guys because, um, you'll be hearing more stuff about me and other people, um, usually on those vlogs. So I hope you guys have a -- had a great weekend. And I'll see you when I make another video and yeah. So bye you guys.
