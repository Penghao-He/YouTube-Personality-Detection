Hey, what's up? This is XXXX. Um, it's been about three or four, maybe more months since I've done a video blog, and I figured I would do one. Um, I know if you watched my other videos. You'll notice that I got a different setting here. I got myself a house, so this is just my little computer area, uh, that I got set aside. So that door opens when my cats are out there and they meow constantly and I don't want my video being full of meow, meow, meow, meow. 
So I figured that I got a lot of hits and a lot of views and a lot of comments on my ITT Tech rant. So I figured I would do a follow up to that, and tell you guys what I'm doing and what I found out and everything. So apparently there is two types of accreditation, National and Regional. All your regular schools like University of Huston, University of Miami, you know, Cornhuskers, Sooners, all that. They're all regional. All the technical schools, ITT tech and stuff like that, they are all national. It doesn't seem like that would be right. It seems national would be more important, but that's not the way it is. Okay. 
So, I searched for -- high and low for a school, U of H told me up yours. You know, South West Texas State laughed and said you might as well just start as a freshman, live on campus. Uh, no. Okay, so my mother is a student currently at Kaplan University, as an online school, and I hear, I can hear the moans right now going eh, online school, no that's a rip off, it's crap. Let me tell you it's not. Kaplan is the real deal. Um, I am proud to announce that Kaplan accepted my degree from ITT Tech and I am now enrolled officially as a junior in undergraduate program at Kaplan Online University and I'm getting a Bachelor of Psychology studying Behavioral Analysis. Now I know that some of you are like, what? It gets worse, a minor in History. 
So here is the deal. I am going to be a high school teacher. I will wait for the shock to set in. I know what I look like. It's a curse. Okay, so I'm a be a high school teacher. When's the last time you had a spring break? Exactly. Okay. I actually do care though. It's real weird. I'm not really sure why I care. I haven't really come up with a reason, but I care. So, being a teacher sounds awesome. Besides all the holidays and the two months in the summer that you get off completely. Wow. Besides all that, it just sounds so fun. So, I want to teach either some sort of history or psychology class or sociology. 
So the way it works where I live, is you don't necessarily have to have a degree in what you teach, but you have to have twenty four credit hours minimum in that, you know, subject. So the way Kaplan works is the last six courses you take are electives and you pick from a list of like five hundred classes. I'm not even kidding. Like twelve accounting courses, everything from typewriting to HTML code, to pharmaceuticals, to law enforcement, to constitutional law. I might take that. Especially if I'm going to teach history, right? Right. Well, some of the courses I have to take for the psychology degree fall under the history category. I only need 24 hours in one subject, so that frees up some more electives. I also have to take physical science, which is kind of shocking to me. I also have to take statistics. I can't even say it. Statistics, there you go, statistics. I am so done. 
So, anyways, the point is I get credit for all this. In fact, Kaplan takes my ITT Tech so much that I'm actually don't have to take intro to physiology because I took it at ITT Tech. When I went to ITT, I had to take physics, one, two, three, and four, English composition, uh, you now, basic computer skills. I had to take sociology and psychology, and government and economics, it was really weird. But -- so they are giving me credit for all that. I'm a veteran. Kaplan has a department just for the military. My academic advisor has a degree, a Bachelor's in Psychology. Perfect. 
Uh, the price? Okay, the price is three hundred fifty five dollars per credit hour, but if you are a veteran, it's two forty. Books, all other fees, all -- everything is included in that price. I'll be done in eighteen months. Eighteen months I'll be a teacher, pretty much. I gotta take a teacher's certification course after that, but I'll deal with that when I'm done with my degree. But I'm telling you, I think you can just yahoo Kaplan. It's spelled with a K. K A-P L-A N. They didn't ask me to do a video, they didn't -- they don't even know I do video blogs or nothing. I'm telling you that this place is -- I know it's legit because my mom is going there. She has her degree, you know, um, I mean she's getting a master's from there. 
Everything is really cool, I mean you take two classes at a time. The last six of the whole school you get to pick from the list from whatever you want. They send you your books for free. If you have access to their Florida big huge public library, they'll actually mail you the actual books. I mean, it's just too good to be true. And let's say later I want to take this degree and go get my master's at like University of Huston, they are the exact same accreditation; they would absolutely be accepted. I mean, the school district, they told me that Kaplan University is on their list of places they accept. The school district told me that. 
So, I found my place, I'm a be a high school teacher. I don't really know if I, um, if it set in yet, but we'll see what happens, you know? Um, so anyways, I hope that this is informative. Uh, if you went to ITT, or you going there, or you've go -- or you're alumni, just check it out, Kaplan. If you are not happy with ITT Tech, and you are currently going there, I bet you -- if you call Kaplan, you can switch to the online, and whatever classes you've already taken at ITT will transfer over. I got out of Intro of Psychology because I took it at ITT. Anyways, I'm XXXX, look for much more in the future. And I'm gonna stop -- try to stop cursing so much, because if I'm a be a teacher, I can't say fuck. Alright, thanks for watching. Peace.
