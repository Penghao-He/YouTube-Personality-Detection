Hello everybody. So today marks a really cool day. You guys can go, right now, and download my song off of iTunes. I know what you're saying, what, XXXX, your song? Since when do you sing? I don't sing, and I know enough about music to know that I'm not a singer. Erm, but what I did, is, I worked with a really, er, a very talented, very cool, group of people out of Europe to create, like, a trance/techno, er, song, and I did voice over for it. And what they did with it, is just, it's freaking awesome, and I'm telling you, it is hot. It is like, have awesome sex to it hot. Erm, so, you probably, you just heard a little bit of it and you can go over to iTunes, you can hear a sample of it, and, it's just -- it is so -- I think you guys are going to absolutely love it. 
Now, here's the thing. If you guys don't love it, I'm not going to do music video, erm, but if you guys love it as much as I think you will, and hope you do, erm, and if sales over there are, you know, adequate enough, we're gonna make a really, really kick ass music video, erm, to probably put on YouTube, and then to also sell on iTunes. But to put out there on YouTube so you guys can see it, erm. We have a production team put together -- er, it could be just so, I mean, hear the song, use your imagination, it's going to be an awesome, awesome video. Erm, if you guys are interested in the song. So I'm going to put the link, over here, and, erm, yeah, over there you can like, download it, not just from iTunes, but if you use other programs, like Amazon, Rhapsody, Napster, all of those, you can download it from like this hub. Erm, so I'm really excited, and please, oh my goodness, please write me, and tell me what you think of it, because that is awesome. And when way you can tell me what you think of it is by calling my number, erm, for those of you, you totally came to use this to work out what the hell that number is, thinking I'm a psycho, who's put my personal number out there on the internet, you can choose to, whether or not you want to, you don't have to if you don't want to call it, but you can choose to sign up for alerts, each time I have news, erm, it can get sent to your 'phone, and, and of course like the main point is that you guys can leave me messages there. 
So, anyway, I think it's hot as hell, and you know, I ramble on and on, so I'll actually keep this, maybe, under five minutes, I don't know, we'll see. Erm, I love you guys, and I will talk to you really, really soon. I just had something like, five popsicles, so I'm hyper. Okay. I love you guys, mwa, mwa, 'bye.
