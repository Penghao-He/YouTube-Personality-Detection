Uh, hey guys, XXXX here. It's been a while, yeah. 
Um, not really here to say much. I just -- I need a request or I have a request, yeah. Um, I'm really -- my iPod. It's -- it's very sad because I -- it's very lonely, there's not many songs on it. There's only like three hundred on it, most of my friends have almost a thousand, and uh, I -- I really want to get more music. 
I'm kind of starting to get to the point where I know all the songs and they're really boring now. So if you guys know any -- any band that you like, tell me 'cause I'm open to try it. 
I'll put over here in the description a list of all that I already got, so I don't get repeats and maybe it'll help you think, you know, hey this band is kind of like them, whatever. I don't know. All I know is I need new music and getting sick of listening to the same songs over and over again. So, if you guys help me out, I would be very appreciative. 
Okay. Thank you.
