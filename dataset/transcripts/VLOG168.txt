Hey guys, it's been ages since I made a video, which I apologize, obviously. But I have two very good reasons why. 
Number one, school. For I've been sitting in a classroom with a few other people, with a man at the front or a woman talking at us and hoping something goes in. That's basically what I've been doing for the past few weeks. But now it's summer. I've got more time. Recently, as well, keeping me out from making videos -- you know it's putting me into the outside world, which I don't usually enter. 
The weather -- it has been gorgeous. It's been sunny. What I really hate about is with the weather -- when it's raining and it's chucking it down, which is ninety percent of the year, everyone's complaining. Oh it's raining, why isn't it sunny? I hate this. Then when it's sunny, oh it's too hot, I'm boiling, make it rain. You know, make up your mind. 
The only problem with our heat waves is, they only last for a few days. I hate that. You know, we've got this forty degrees of sun, beating down on us. It's beautiful. And then suddenly God realizes His mistake, oh God, I've made it sunny in Britain, so let's punish them with forty days of thunderous storm and that's what we had. After the beautiful heat wave, we had just rain and they chucked it down for -- it was like four months of rain in one day just because He'd realized that He'd played Britain sunny for a few days. Really ticks me off. 
So I guess school and sun have been keeping me away from the internet and outside, not sure about that. The only problem with the summer; it does make you realize that there's nothing to do at home unless it's sunny. You know, you're stuck inside wondering, what can I do? I guarantee, you'll all be bored at least once this summer. 
I'll also guarantee you'll go to the cinema at least once and unfortunately you're probably go to see Ice Age in three D. The great thing about that, apart from the awful movie, they give you free pair of glasses. You know, brilliant, I'm giving my pair of glasses instead of keeping them in my pocket and they ended up being thrown away; as I was bored one Saturday morning, I did a bit of um, arts and crafts um, and with a permanent marker and a pair of scissors, I created my very own design with three D glasses. 
Here we go. Yeah, you know, I was bored, so I thought, why not? I said, I'm really sad at the moment, I had nothing to do and the craze at the moment, with what everyone is wearing, and these wacky sunglasses, you know, that you got the bright yellow pink ones. You know, you got loads of them, so I thought why not make my own? Okay, you like it? Yeah? I think that's gonna be my new look, there you go.
