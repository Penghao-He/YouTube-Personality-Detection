Hi there, um, I'm just guarding my son's pet cat. She's here, so sorry. If I'm getting messed up, I didn't realize, I don't know how to use this too well. 
Um, yeah, I just got a few things to talk about, so I haven't done a vlog in a long time, so I'm so sorry. 
Uh yeah, so you probably noticed that uh, all the pages have changed. So, like, that's pretty fucked up, I mean, I -- you, you know I was against it, so I hate the new design, it's just a sham and it's -- it's a pain in the arse, okay, that's it. 
Um -- so what I'm gonna talk about now, which is gonna get on to the subject of the video, is Veo, uh, if you haven't heard of Veo, it's a video site -- slightly like YouTube although they have um, the ability to support videos up to whatever, hours and hours. Uh, so yeah, I watch like a lot of TV on it but uh, I think it was whether it -- late last week, yeah, I was -- uh, forced to do an upload or a -- update, update, sorry, sorry, or and uh, the forced update, so I don't know what the fuck that was, and now, they're -- I have it here, up on Firefox, actually, its not working on that either and this is being filmed on Evernight four eight. . .
