Hello everybody. Ooh, that looks really bad. Um, uh, Jesus -- anyway, here I am, uh, on Tuesday, January twentieth two thousand nine, Inauguration Day. Everybody should be pretty happy, uh, even if you're guy that didn't get voted in, at least we're getting rid of Bush. Um, so I'm sitting here, watching the inauguration. 
One thing I actually find extremely neat is the Marine Corps band. 
-- Is performing up on Capitol Hill, you know what, I'd like to just listen a little. 
They're performing right now. 
Um -- Ladies and gentleman, the members of the one hundred and eleventh House of Representatives of the United States, led by Majority Whip JC Claymbers and Republican Whip Eric Cantor. 
So, who's happy? Post a video response, post comments. Rate the video I guess, whatever. 
I'd also thought I'd take this opportunity to say, uh, and I'm gonna give this some sort of obscure name so that it's really just my subscribers that see this. I don't want to attract a bunch of people who are just looking up Obama on the, uh, search, um. 
I think I posted a video explaining why I haven't been around or something like that. I bet I had other videos that I made, uh, excuse me -- that I was going to post and I don't even remember what they are anymore and I just, I'm not planning on posting 'em. Um, I am gonna, however, come up with some sort of Nikon D ninety review and uh, -- oh what else was it, somebody was wanting to say something. Well, whatever it is -- oh, the Storm, the Blackberry Storm, I'll do that. 
Sold my iPhone today, sold my baby. Or yesterday, um, supposed to be for five hundred bucks but he Jewed me down to four fifty and I actually forgot the power adapter, so I didn't fight him too hard on that. I guess, yeah, this is it. 
It really sucks, because I never use it. I plug it into the computer, when I plugged it into the computer. And actually I have two of these, I had the one that -- this one, which is the bad one. And then there's the one with the green dot on it which is the fixed one, um, from Apple. This one doesn't melt or -- no, no. This one doesn't have the tongs that rip off and stay in the outlet, um, hmm. 
That's about all I know today, I'm not gonna keep you guys too long, I got some exciting things happening. I'm gonna have new appliances brought it. They're supposed to be here Thursday, and uh, as a surprise when my aunt comes home. Other than that, I'm gonna have laminate wood flooring that looks like a medium shade of oak or something. 
I have -- what got me going on this is one morning I was boiling water on the stove, forgot about it, came in here -- I think it's when I was making those videos actually -- or no, maybe not. Um, anyway I started smelling something really funny and uh, it just hit me so I ran in there and there was the pot, glowing red, sinking into the stove, it welded itself to the stove. 
So, I had to get new appliances and therefore I decided while the appliances are out of the room, or I have them deliver them to the front room or something, I could have that floor done, which is half carpet, half linoleum, and we just found out by peeling it back, or from what we could tell, it was put in with the house and the house was built sixty years ago. Yeah, at least sixty years ago. The carpet's already disgusting in the kitchen -- well, it's disgusting anyway, sorta, but in the kitchen especially. I just can't -- well, anyway, so this was definitely well overdue. 
I'm gonna let you guys go. Have a happy Inauguration Day and uh, have a happy anything else that you guys might be happy for -- happy upcoming digital TV day or something, I think that's on my birthday. Well, yeah, cheers.
