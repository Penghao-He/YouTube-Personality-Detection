Hello everyone. This is the XXXX, and it is official, Tiger Woods has just admitted that transgressions have caused the integrity of his family to be in question here. And, if you haven't been following along, there's been a lot of shit going down with Mr. Woods, and if you don't know who he is look him up. He's a professional golfer, you know, perhaps you've heard of him. And the other day he got in a car accident -- I'm probably gonna use the quote fingers a lot here. Uh, he got in a car accident on Fri -- last Friday, uh, and it was reported that there was a possible martial dispute between he and his wife. And a number of rumors have been circulating and it turns out that Tiger Woods was having a relationship. And the specifics of the relationship, you know, not to, you know, throw Tiger completely under the bus, but the specifics of this relationship with one Jamiee Grubbs surfaced. 
Now, a number of pieces of evidence have come fourth, and one of which was a phone call that Jamiee Grubbs had on her phone. And it was Tiger calling her, you know, saying, hey, you know, my wife is on us, um, please remove your -- my name from your phone, so that way when I call it just shows up as a number, not as, you know, Tiger, or whatever, blah, blah, blah. And it was -- it was basically Tiger doing cover up work because he didn't want the truth of the matter to get out here, which was basically his admission of guilt in the matter. 
So, the proof is in the pudding, and Tiger Woods literally just put out a statement, ah, saying that he regrets the transgressions -- and I love the fact that he used transgressions, and, um, such a -- such a lawyer word -- but um, he put out this statement saying, you know, he -- he is sorry that what he has done has caused his family grief, and, um, it may turn out that the, uh, the quote unquote accident that happened was his wife flipping the hell out and beating the shit out of him and his Cadillac. So, it's -- it's kind of amazing here, it -- and I find this amazing in a number of ways. Number one, it's not really, uh, particularly anyone's business as to what exactly went down, um, I mean, just -- I feel that people are gonna go too far with this, and they're gonna delve in, and try to find every detail and -- okay, Tiger Woods is caught. 
His hand is in the cookie jar, he can't deny this, he has the phone calls, they have the car accident, they have the pissed off wife -- I mean, Tiger's not gonna be able to recover from this and just, you know, pat everyone on the back and be like, oops, my bad, let's all just move on. So, people are probably gonna delve into this too much, but the reason why I said this is amazing is that this is another example of just another guy being a dumb shit. Now, you guys have to understand, Tiger Woods is just this multi million dollar commodity, if you will. He's this wholesome, clean cut image that has been relatively flawless in his career, and the path that he's chosen for his career. I mean, he is the go to guy that you would want advertising your product, he's the guy a politician would want endorsing him, he is everything. 
And yet, he got caught up in a relationship outside of his marriage that could have nothing but damning ramifications if things were discovered. Why the hell, Tiger, would you risk all that just for some pussy? And let's be realistic, that's what it was. Have you seen this girl? I don't think Tiger was talking to her 'cause she's, you know, great conversation at the dinner table. Maybe he was, okay, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he was, but you know what, she's a piece of ass, she's hot as hell. I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why Tiger was talking to this girl. So, it -- just, one thing I just want to say out there is just these guys who get caught in relationships like this -- how can you not be petrified of going into a relationship like this? Tiger is married, Tiger has two kids, Tiger has this career, and this public image that is flawless. 
What if this Jaimee Grubbs girl wanted to blackmail him? And for all we know, maybe that's what happened here. Maybe she was trying to get some information out of him, and got this voicemail and other information -- she will sell it to the highest bidder at this point. And rumor has it, Us Weekly paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars just for that voicemail that got released that Tiger had called Jaimee with. So, why do people like Tiger Woods risk everything just for some extramarital relationship? Like, Tiger, was it really worth it? Was it worth it to risk your entire career? And God knows how much you're gonna be able to recover from this, 'cause your squeaky clean image is shot. I mean, not to take anything away from his golf play, because he's gonna go down as the greatest man to ever play that sport. 
And yes, I call it a sport, even though some people will argue it's not a sport. But anyways, um, I don't know, I just -- I just find this amazing. It's just -- it's just another squeaky clean guy that everyone could look up to -- he just let people down, he just let people down with this. I mean it's like you're in a happy marriage that, well, looks happy, I mean we don't know behind closed doors. But, why can't you just be happy with the wife and the kids and everything, and just set a good example? And like I said, Tiger, what the hell would you have done if this lady decided to blackmail you? You don't think that there's people out there, uh, just women and men for that matter, that are trying to find, uh, multi millionaires to con out of their money and get a inch of information that they can blackmail you with? 
Turns out this Jaimee Grubbs had a lot more than that. And like I said, not that she's absolutely blackmailed him, but, boy, if she wanted to do that, he gave her quite a bit of information to do so with. So, I don't know, people, what the hell do you think? Is Tiger Woods just retarded for this? Because, in all honesty, that's the only way I can look at it. It's just an absolute act of just retarded behavior. You have the world in the palm of your hand, and you're just gonna throw it away with shit like this. Shame on you, Tiger, what the hell where you thinking? So, anyways here people, um, yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be more details to come out on this, and I'll probably end up making a follow up video 'cause I don't think we've heard the half of it yet. 
'Cause there is gonna be a lot more to be said, and uh, we're probably gonna have to buckle up, but like I said, it isn't really anyone's business, anything else that happened beyond this. But um, yeah, go ahead and drop your thoughts and opinions -- I'm sure you guys have your own renditions of what you think went down here. But um, Tiger, disappointed in you, um, you know. I don't really care too much about golf but I can respect your game, and uh, that image you held out as being an upstanding citizen and, you know, having the wife and kids and all that -- it's all gone now. It's all shot. It's all shot. You're just -- you're just now no more than a typical male that cheated on his wife. 
And, yeah, cheated includes even if you didn't have any sort of sexual relationship -- cheating involves all that was going on, 'cause, like I said, that phone message you left her, that didn't sound like someone, you know, you didn't want to talk to because you were talking about world affairs over dinner with. So, yeah, Tiger, shame on you, and um, God knows how much you're gonna be able to recover from this, and God knows what else is gonna come out, but I'll be watching to see what else comes out next, cause, yeah, it's gonna be a bumpy ride for you. Have a great day everyone.
