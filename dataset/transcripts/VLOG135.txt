Good morning, XXXX, I am XXXX and this is Hank sock -- a sock version of me. 
Hello! 
And the XXXX and I are here to tell you some very exciting news. I guess a couple of months ago, XXXX and I decided that we were really interested in the possibility of getting a real life, online video conference in order to get all of the best online video creators together in the same place, and the communities that support those groups in order to get like, uh, uh, an entire epic, gigantic weekend of fun and growing the community and doing awesome things. 
That's your big news? 
Yeah. That -- that's my -- I mean, the news is that we're actually gonna do it and it's gonna be this summer in Los Angeles from July ninth to July eleventh. 
Your big news is that a bunch of you and your nerdy friends are gonna get together and drink Juicy Juices and hang out and talk about nerdy stuff? 
Well -- I mean, XXXX I don't think that you understand that online video is is like, a really huge deal. 
Well I got ingrown toenail that's a really huge deal but I'm not making a conference about it. 
Um, I'm having a really hard time figuring out how you could have an ingrown toenail. 
Well, yeah. It's complicated. 
Anyway, online video is an entirely new medium it's creating new genres and really active, engaged, and a large communities of people. Believe it or not, there are probably going be, like, a hundred thousand people watching this video that we're making right now. 
Hmm? Out of my hair! 
Um, your hair is surprisingly sparkly. I never noticed that your hair was sparkly. 
Yeah, I use product. What? 
Nothing, don't worry about it. 
So who's gonna be there? 
Uh, well, a lot of people are gonna be there. People from XXXX all the way from XXXX, like, to XXXX, but also people from all over the world of online video. We've got Michael Buckley , Dave Dayes , Jay Carl , Brittney Louis Taylor , Ray William Johnson , David Choy , Redin Link , Mitchell Davis , me, my brother, Julian Noons , Natalie Tran -- I can't believe we have freaking Natalie Tran! Shane Dawson --
Shane Dawson? 
Yeah, Shane Dawson! 
I love that guy! 
Yeah I know, I love him, too! 
Feel better, Shane! 
The success of these of these projects isn't based on, like, million dollar marketing budgets or or the ungodly beauty of the people who started them. 
Well, that's for sure. 
Yeah, thanks. It's based on what I think is the raw ability to entertain, and people who are able to bring people into the communities so that they watch every new video that gets put up -- not just when they light their face on fire or capture a particularly adorable cat moment. 
God, I love that cat. 
Yeah, I know, I love that cat too. But the cat's not gonna be there -- we couldn't get the cat for the conference. But there are going to be many of the most successful people in online video and that list that I gave you earlier isn't even a complete list and we're gonna have demonstrations and we're gonna have talks and performances by these people. We're gonna have concerts and dance parties and we're gonna have all kinds of crazy things that we can't even think of yet and we're gonna ask the community to present ideas for us --
Like karaoke? 
Karaoke is a very good idea. Thank you, that's an excellent idea. 
I want a ball pit. 
A ball pit? Yes, a ball pit is another great idea. Do you have other ideas? 
What about a booth where Charlie McDonough sits and he bites people's fingers so they can say, ouch, ouch, Charlie. 
I will talk to Charlie about that. There's gonna be an insider track that's gonna be basically for people who are really into YouTube and wanna, like, get down on the down and dirty specifics of creating a community on YouTube and the business and and the future of YouTube. It is gonna cost money -- it's -- the registration is going to cost money because these things cost a lot of money to put on. If you wanna find out more, there's lots more information on the website which is at vidcon twenty ten dot com, and you can check out our Twitter feed at twitter. com/vidcon, and our YouTube channel of course youtube. com/vidcon. I think that's all I wanted to talk about. XXXX, XXXX, we'll see you at VidCon.
