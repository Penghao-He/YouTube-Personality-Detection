Let's go on an adventure. 
Hey man, uh, XXXX. I just wanted to say, uh, I've been recognized for my blogs and it's not necessarily good. Um -- every time I get recognized -- which has been like four times maybe, uh -- they go and tell me dude, you're not very good at all. I'm like really? Like I don't even know you and they, like, go and criticize me. But I guess criticism comes with fame. I don't know. But yeah. This one's going out to Jestubed in case you guys didn't notice I may make this the daily -- the -- the -- the true number forty one, but -- um -- yeah. So -- um -- like I was said -- whenever I get recognized it's like dude, you're not very good at that blogging thing. And you're so boring. And like why --why are you shirtless half the time? I'm like, I don't know man. I don't know. I just enjoy -- you know-- doing what other people don't. And since I'm the only -- uh -- local blogger that does the naked thing. I'm still waiting for -- uh -- Two Two Tune Forty Two - you know -- get naked 'cause I think everyone wants to see that. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. Okay. Well let you guys get up -- ah -- leaning against the, uh, door frame -- naked. Ooooh. Oh no. No. No. No. You don't get that far. All right, guys. I'll see you later.
