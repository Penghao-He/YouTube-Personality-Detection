As you can see, I got my eyes busted. Okay so I was walking home from school today and this car drove past me and there was a guy sitting in the -- in the driver's seat, obviously because he needed a driver to drive the car, and this guy, I swear, he had no clothes on. 
And it's really not that hot today; I'd say it's about twenty three or twenty four. So, I swear, this guy was not wearing any pants, he was not wearing any underwear and he was not wearing a shirt. Seriously, please put some clothes on. I mean, just for your own self preservation. Just -- and your indignity, just please put some clothes on. 
I mean I know twenty three degrees, you might start to get a little bit sweaty and -- and you might start to feel a little bit hot, but that does not mean you need to take your clothes off. You can keep your clothes on. 
Maybe turn the air conditioner on, maybe open a window, maybe -- maybe open a window, you know? Maybe, I don't know, just don't take your clothes off. It's just a really bad idea. Just don't do it in a car, or on YouTube. 
Okay, so if you can guess what this song is then you are one of the coolest people in the world.  
Um, that's kind of obvious and actually don't know the name of that song. Actually, I do but it's -- it's very mainstream. I could've sorta -- I could've sorta hummed any other song . I couldn't think of one and it's the first one that came to my mind, so yeah, if you could just tell me what that song is then you're awesome. 
Cool. See ya later. See ya on Friday. I'll do a video then. 
Goodbye.
