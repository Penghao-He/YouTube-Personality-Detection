Hi, guys. Uh, this is, uh, XXXX. Also known as a XXXX now to my more popular fan base, or, the fan base to which I am more popular, or something. I -- I don't even know, you know. I -- I'm through with trying to come up with witty introductions because I ain't got 'em today. I'm too tired for that shit. Thankfully I do have like six days off, so maybe I can try to do some catching up on things, but. A lot of people told me I need to make a blog on here again, so here I am. Here I am making a blog. Whoopty doo. 
And people have also asked me this, um -- I -- I guess people can sense that I've been a little out of sorts, lately, that I've been a little unfocused, kind of not all there. And it's true. I've had quite a bit on my mind lately, so maybe this is the place where I can come and kinda talk about it, I guess, I don't know. I figure, I didn't make this channel for nothing. Might as well use it for something. The thing is, I don't want to come on here and sit here and piss and moan, you know, because that's just not my style, these days, to do that. I'd rather do that, you know, to my video camera for my future self than to sit here and burden other people with having to listen to it, but -- I suppose if you really want to hear it just , I'll try to keep it tame. Well, I guess one of the big things is that they've cut hours at work again. They've basically been cutting them for, like, the better part of the year now. I mean, at first it was, you know, started out 40 and then it was down to, like, thirty eight. I remember complaining when it was thirty eight. I'm like, "Dude, thirty eight. " What's the big difference? But it was thirty eight. I guess that made a big difference to me, well. Try fourteen, okay? Then come back to me and complain about your thirty eight hours, seriously. Fourteen, that's how many hours I had last week. Ooh, there's a fart; that's all I can say about that. You know, it's -- you know, and I don't like complaining about this kind of stuff on line because people see it and all. You know, and this -- it's not like this is something that anyone actually in the store can do anything about, so I guess I feel a little more comfortable knowing that I can, you know, leave them with that knowledge that I don't blame them for it, or anything like that. It's just that, you know, with the bad economy right now, and pretty basically everyone's in the shitter because of it. It's not just me. There's as lot of people suffering. 
We actually had one person who quit two days ago. I -- I didn't think she was going to. I couldn't believe she did. She was, like, one of the last persons I thought was going to quit in there. Or she was one of the last people. Did I say persons? Oh my God. I really am . Yeah, I didn't expect her to be the next one to quit. I did not see that coming at all. But she -- she'd been there, like, longer than I have, and -- but -- but I can't say I blame her, and apparently a lot of people said the same thing, they don't blame her either. Uh, she was a full time worker, basically being scheduled for fifteen hours a week. Now, I -- I was dropped to part time in July, so it's understandable in my case, to some extent. But, jeez, full time; Fifteen hours a week -- next thing you know, the bills are coming in and you can't pay 'em. And it's like, "Uh oh. Uh oh, Spaghetti O. " Whatcha gonna do? 
So I'm thinking I might have to start looking for a second job pretty soon, because I'm in a pretty bad spot right now. I was supposed to put new tires on the car this month and I'm not going to be able to do that now, so. And that's bad, because I bought the car in two thousand and four and I haven't changed the tires on it since I bought it. So these tires are five years old now. I'm driving in snow, that's real great. And then I have this other thing, where I'm trying to make a Machinima, which is basically, for those who don't know, it's basically, like, you take a video game -- you take video game footage and add dialogue to it that doesn't belong there. 
Holy crap. What was that? Uh, anyway. You take video game footage and you add dialogue that doesn't belong there to make it funny. And that's basically Machinima. Video game footage; it's a movie made out of video game footage. Usually comedy, sometimes, something else. Anyway, so I'm trying to make one out of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, but I have two big problems. Number one is that I -- well, actually I have three problems. Number one is that I don't actually own my own copy of Brawl, so I've been renting one from the family video store. Number two is that the two characters I need to make my Machinima with, I haven't unlocked them yet, because it takes like freaking twenty hours of game play to do that, and it's just too depressing for me to sit there all that time. But if it takes twenty hours just to get to the point where I can start on making the video, then the number three problem is I'm trying to get rid of the damage gage at the bottom of the screen, what's just kind of a minor detail that I -- I don't know if everybody does it, but apparently you have to hack your Wii to do it. I don't know if I really want to do that, since I run the risk of just disabling it altogether. 
So I might just have to, like, come up with a different idea. It's just that I had this really good idea that I been thinking about for the last week, and I wanted to do it, and I been -- I even told the Machinima people about it, and they said they liked it. So -- so I'm just trying to make the video, and I can't freaking do it. Like I have all the voice acting ready to go, the script is ready to go, I just don't have the video game footage. So, I don't know what to do. 
Otherwise, I guess there's not a whole lot. It's a nice Halloween, actually. I'm probably going to sleep through it. Ahh. I -- I could look around and see if there's a party to go to or something, I don't know. I just -- one year ago tonight, actually, was our Halloween party. Dad hosted for Karaoke. It was one year ago tonight that we found out my Dad had cancer. And, uh, so that's kinda, you know, that's depressing too. But, at the same time, I almost can't help but feel proud of him for having survived it for a year. I mean, how many people can say that they survived cancer for a year? Most people find out they have it, you never know how long they got. So. I know my Dad's always been a fighter. I mean, he was in the army, so I know that he's better than this and he's gonna kick it. It's all just a matter of time, really. 
But, in the meantime, I just wish I could do more to help him, I mean, shit, I don't know. Holy shit. Wait; what? Oh, that's me. I'm in here. Oh my God, I'm in the phonebook. Jeez, I didn't know that. Yeah, okay. There's actually eight Bishops in this city. I had no idea there was that many Bishops. Oh, man. Okay, well now that starts to make me -- I thought Bishop was like a rare last name or something. I'm sitting here wondering, 'cause I have, like, a poster at work of my Dad, Mickey Bishop, you know, who's up, you know, with the cancer benefit thing. And, like -- like I still think that even with that poster hanging in there for a month, nobody even knows that my Dad's got cancer, 'cause I've never told anybody besides the HR lady. You know, and I use that as, like, an excuse, because I had -- I was tardy for work that day and she wanted to know why. And I said because that was the day I found out my Dad had cancer, and I just wasn't all here. And she was totally understanding about it. But as far as he had, I sure as hell got no right to complain about my life, I'll tell you that. I should be able to get my shit together here, go to Wal Mart, put in an application, do something -- just, you know, do something now while I still can, 'cause I -- you know, I'm still alive and I'm still kicking and I'm doing pretty successful on Nintendo Capri Sun, in fact . You know -- you know this might sound bad, but I actually think that the stuff I'm doing on Nintendo Capri Sun is probably the most successful thing I've ever done in my life. And I know most people say, "Well, you're thirty three years old and you play video games. You're a loser. " Yeah, just go do your butt flexes, you know. Yeah, would you rather me go exercise? Would that be more interesting? 
You know the most hilarious thing about it is, that the only people you ever see out running are the ones that don't need to, you know, the ones who are already in shape, the ones that have a good enough metabolism that they don't have to waste their time on it yet they do anyway. You know, the ones that just run in your face and say, "Hey, " you know, "look at me. Look what I can do. " It's like, "Yeah, well it's easy for you because it's not physically painful, you know, like it is for someone like me with two hundred and thirty pounds. " Can you imagine what that feels like, two hundred and thirty pounds of weight slamming down on the sole of your feet, you know, once every ten seconds? Huh. If you were laying down when somebody was doing that, I guaran -- fucking -- tee you it would hurt like hell. I guarantee you. And yet, when you're running, no, it shouldn't hurt at all. It should feel good. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. You can't even explain how. You can't even explain how. Uh huh. Uh huh. Yes, I'm being sarcastic, even though, honestly, I really don't know what the explanation is. I don't know what the jive answer is to that one. Okay, so I will see you guys next time. Uh, let's play . Oops, I did it again. See ya.
