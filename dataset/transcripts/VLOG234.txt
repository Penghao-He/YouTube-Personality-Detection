Yeah so um, my, my friend very kindly made me this desk. It was very nice of him um, yeah because it quite a good desk it's got more room and I can do blogs from under it and that's handy but I need to have something done with the cables though they're kind of, I don't know, looks a bit messy. Oh and I, and I think I haven't done a blog since my hair cut which I got a while ago. I mean it is shorter now it is kind of more manageable. Um normally, normally I would have school today because it's Friday but um, I don't cause there's exams going on. Next week I have got mets, Japanese, and English. So all of this weekend and today I suppose I should be studying for them. So, ye, um I can really think of anything to say, this is like a thirst ball all over again. So ah wa wa wa wa wa yeah, so I better go and a study some mets stuff um, ah , um, okay, so, um bye.
﻿So, I'm doing a blog and stuff. Um, I haven't done a blog in ages. Gotten like, you know, like fifty messages from all my fans being like, do another blog, so I'm like, eh, ye. Ye, I guess I better do another blog. Um, and, er ye, um, lots of stuff has changed since my last blog. I've got this thing, um, show you this, is a disc.
