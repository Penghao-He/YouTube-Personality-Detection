This is a response to XXXX. Um, okay, so the first question, would you kill a butterfly for a week's paid vacation. No, I wouldn't be able to do it. I just wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know like, stepping on a butterfly, I might -- but I couldn't like, take a butterfly and like, pull its wings off, like that's just sadistic and not right. I wouldn't be able to do it, even for a month's vacation, I wouldn't be able to do it. 
Um, would you add one year of your life for taking someone else's? No, I wouldn't be able to do that either because, you know -- like, I don't want to die, but I don't want to be responsible for someone else dying too. You know, like, taking years off another life so I can live another year -- what's good about me that makes me -- like -- able to take someone else's and be okay with it; I wouldn't be able to do it. So that's a no. 
 Would you urinate with someone else? I've done it before. Um, I'm a girl so we go to the bathroom in groups. So, yes, I could do it, whatever right, so long as they don't make any comments about hearing it so easily, but, yeah, I'm okay with it, it's fine, whatever, right. 
Are you going to ask me. I'm very good about that actually. I enjoy getting coupled, because I don't like doing things on my own. Like cooking, I'll do on my own, but I like having someone there you know you can talk to and later on you can go or whatever. You know I don't like working by myself because it gets very lonely. You know when there are lots of people answering, it gets very lonely, because you know you can't really talk to your customers about like, other things -- and you're not really friends with them so it gets very lonely. 
Uh, if there was a public execution, would you watch? No. I really wouldn't; I don't want to watch someone die. I don't care; I don't care how bad they were; I don't care who would want to watch? Okay, yeah, someone's getting executed. You know, I don't want to watch somebody die. I don't watch The Simpsons, but I'd rather watch The Simpsons than watch an execution. Um, so, I apologize for the dark circles. 
I'm logging off; I'm extremely tired.
