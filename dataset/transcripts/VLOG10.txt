Hey everybody, it's Monday, July twenty seventh, two thousand and nine and that means it's time for another edition of XXXX. 
Governor Palin's back in the news this week as she transitions from Alaska governor to Alaskan citizen. Pending all power to Lieutenant Governor Parnell, she had a few choice words for the Media. 
It is, as throughout all Alaska, that big wild, good wife teaming along the road that is north to the future. That's what we get to see every day. Now what the rest of America gets to see along with us, is in this last frontier there is hope and opportunity and there is country pride. And it is our man and women in uniform securing it. And we are facing tough challenges in America with some seeming to just be hell bent maybe on tearing down our nation, perpetuating some pessimism and suggesting American apologetics. 
What? 
And we can resist enslavement to big central government that pressures hope and opportunity. Be wary of accepting government largesse. It doesn't come free and often accepting it takes away everything that is free. Melting into Washington's powerful, caretaking arms will just suck incentive to work hard and charge our own course right out of us. 
Uh, wait. Is that -- no way, what? She made a good point there at the end. But sometimes I have to wonder if I'm listening to Sarah Palin or Nicholas Fain . 
In other news over the weekend I heard the story of Troy Anthony Davis. Do you know who he is? You should. 
Mister Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of an off duty Savannah, Georgia police officer named Mark McPhail back in nineteen ninety one. Davis was convicted solely on the testimony of nine eye witnesses. Since that time three eye witnesses have recanted, admitting that they were coerced and two other eye witnesses admitted that they never even saw the murder take place. 
Despite a wealth of information that has been presented to the court and some new evidence yet to be presented, Mister Davis remains on death row after eighteen years. For more information about Troy Anthony Davis and how you can help in his case, check out IAMTROY dot com. 
That's all I've got for this week for everybody. I hope you enjoyed the show because although I started recording on Monday, July twenty seventh, it's Tuesday, July twenty eighth and that time has come. Gotta get out of here for work, new work schedule, so until next time, keep checking out XXXX dot com for daily blog posts, updates and etcetera and meet me back here Monday for new video or XXXX. Thanks for watching.
