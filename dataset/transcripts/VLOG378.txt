Do you remember your first computer? So I was writing this paper for my consumerism class on that kind of topic and it got me thinking. Our parents tell us stories about remembering getting their first television or switching from black and white to color, and our grandparents still reminisce about the radio. But we are the generation who when we have our own kids, are gonna be saying things like, my first computer only had five hundred twelve megabytes of RAM, and I had to walk two miles in the snow uphill both ways just to get to Frye's , to get my floppy disc. 
I was eight when my family got our first computer. I was busy playing outside when my dad was hooking it up. I remember him sitting me down and saying, XXXX, this is a very big day that you're going to remember for the rest of your life. I also remember looking at him at this point, saying cool, then asking if I could go back outside so I could play on my swing set, which was, at the time, incredibly superior in fun levels to this boring computer my parents were trying to get me to play with. 
About a year later, I had my first experience with the Internet. I was in elementary school, and my classroom had one computer that they had at the back of the room. And there's this one day that they let every single person in my class have fifteen minutes to go surf the web. During my turn, I just sat down and stared at the screen for a minute before turning to the person who's supervising us and saying, so what do I do? She told me to check out a website -- to search for something that I like. I remember that I typed in Hanson, went to some weird Hanson fan site, looked around for five minutes and got bored, and then gave up the rest of my turn to someone else. 
A lot's changed since then. So basically, I was wondering what your first experiences were with the computer or with the Internet. Were you old enough to remember it? Were you super excited about it or did you just not care, like me? I mean, granted, this was a very long time ago. Also, if you want to see the latest adventures in the apartment rent series, then you can check out the link to the Mosbeys in video in the sidebar thing. Seriously, our family's first computer, in order for me to play my Baby Sitters Club game, my dad had to actually uninstall my brother's Tonka truck game because we only had enough hard drive space to have one game installed at a time. Those were the days. Okay that's all for now. See ya. Also if you want to see what's -- ha ha. I had to uninstall the apartment rent story. Argh.
