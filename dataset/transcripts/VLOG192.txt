So, I was outside -- I know big, scary place, uhh. I was outside recording a video and then my neighbors came home. And I had to pretend that there was a valid reason I was carrying around my laptop dressed, like this, you can't even see, I'm wearing a skirt. I'm wearing a skirt and this. And I had to pretend that I wasn't insane when I quite clearly am. So, it was fun, awkward, really awkward. You should be seeing that probably in two days, maybe, don't quote me on that, I never said that. Shh. 
Anyway I just wanted to drop in. I hadn't posted on this journal a while, so I figured I would tell you guys about that lovely incident and the things I do for you guys. The things I do for you. 
That would have been great if, like, I would say the things I do for you and that would have ended, but since I had to move my mouse to get it on like the little, like quick capture stop thing, kind of messed it up a bit.
