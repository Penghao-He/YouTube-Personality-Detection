Hey, guys. I think it's time for Chubby Bunny by XXXX, XXXX and that's Judy. Judy my sister. And first of all Judy, I am going to beat you. You're not going to beat me, yeah. You're going downtown. Not only have I been tired, I've been caught out. Jason from Inside a Penguin has called me out for a contest. We've already had this live on XXXX and I won -- I won. So I think that if you bet on me or Jason, then I should be the one to be bet on because I won last time. I'm gonna win again. I'm gonna win again. What you gonna do about that? 
All right, so let's start this. I have a water bottle. I have marshmallows and I have a bag just in case -- you know what happens. Flying Chubby Bunnies. Okay. So let's start this. 
 Chubby Bunny . Chubby Bunny . Chubby Bunny . Chubby Bunny . Mmmmm . Mmmmm . Mmmmm . Mmmmm . Mmmmm . Mmm mmm. 
I don't think I won the contest, but I don't feel like saying that I lost. I'm -- I'm gonna bet on myself that I won and if I'm wrong then you can make fun of me more, so, yeah, Jason, I beat you. I beat you. I beat you. You owe me two things. 
I lose. Guess who's the loser? I am. Apparently. I haven't seen it yet though. Jason had ten to eleven marshmallows and I remembered last night when I was playing with him on XXXX. He was, like, Cindy , you have really big cheeks, you're going to win. Think? No. So, yeah. Jason wins this round. I'll win the next one. We'll see. 
So now I'm gonna tag people. Um, I will tag Yan, Abby, Aaron and Romaine, Johnny, Leo and Kyle , and I'll have their links on the side so that you can check their channels out because those people are pretty cool. Not as cool as Dustin though. Dustin is way cool, so cool he won't even do Chubby Bunny. 
I wonder why. Bye.
