Hi, I would like to bring to your attention a new type of hatred, emo bashing. Twice, over the past two days; that's once a day I have been subjected to this by what I refer to as Nazi Aryan elitists. The most shocking thing about all of this; I'm not even emo. Apparently, because I dye my hair; listen to Fallout Boy, My Chemical Romance, and All American Rejects; dress in skull themed black clothing; and refer to myself as emo on Myspace, FaceBook, BeBo and as much as possible. These conformist pigs have labeled me an emo. 
But what is emo bashing? Well I'll give you two examples. First of all, I was at this party and I'd sabotaged this music system to play nothing but real music, and this chick was like, uh, what's with all the emo music? And I found this really hurtful and really, really super unfair. So, I turned around and said to her what's wrong with emos? And then she responded, and I'm not exaggerating, oh my cat, I'm not exaggerating, because I'm not exaggerating just to make my stories more credible, but she said emos, they're all whiney, arrogant, self absorbed, losers, and it doesn't help that they look ridiculous. 
Well, here's my well thought out response that I responded with, maybe I said it at the time or I thought it up later, don't be sassy, you obviously are too closed minded to understand anything, you capitalist. How can you judge people based on a biased opinion like that? How many emos did you even know? None. Then how can you make blanket assumptions about their personalities? Unned . 
And I mean, I don't mean to compare the mild dislike of the subculture as something as serious as racism, but this is tantamount to racism. I mean, look at slavery if George Washington, or whoever was in charge of that, had sat down and talked to some slaves maybe he would have liked them. I mean, rap music does suck, but it's still possible. And then this morning some chick outed me from MySpace and she was, like, really rude. She told me that my blogs were really retarded and that I need to get a life, because I didn't have one. I was so angry that I skipped university to make this video blog. What a bi --
