Hey everyone, how's it going? I hope this video finds you well. Last week I recorded a video and as I was editing through it, I realized that it was more of a series than one simple little video and so I was going to set up a big series little thing that I had a really clever name for, but I completely forget what the -- the name of it is gonna be and realize that it's gonna take a little while to edit and so I did another video in the interim and then figured I'll get back to the other video that I recorded last week before this going to be turning into the series with clever name. 
Anyways, it doesn't really matter because of the fact that I have to do this rant right now, which, if I ever get through the series and to the series and present the series to you, then you will really really appreciate this rant because you have no idea -- and it's -- I mean it's not big -- well, it's big to me, okay? So other people would just kinda probably sit back and laugh, but right now I'm like, ooh, I have to do a rant, I have to do a rant, I have to do a rant or else my head's going to explode. 
A couple of weeks ago I spent two days at my father's house, setting up his DSL. Actually it was cable. He already had cable but he still had dial up and so we had to switch the dial up. And of course when you had to, to switch it, they didn't just let you get the, the -- you know, he was like he already has cable, so that would be cool if you could just put your phone and cable and make those little bundles, you know, those little bundles. But you had to upgrade the bundles in order to use the bundles. 
He had cable, but in order to get the bundle which had the high speed internet, he had to upgrade his cable to digital cable. And he had to upgrade his phone, his regular phone, to digital phone. 
Okay, now, the digital cable turned into, he had to get a box and he had to do all this other stuff -- my father is like seventy something years old. And he was pretty much -- you know what, I really like what you -- I had before. Is there any way that I can keep it? And basically the company was like, no actually you can't because if you actually keep it, you'll have to pay more. I'm sorry, did you just say I have to pay more for a lesser service? Um, excuse me? Yeah. 
So basically what you're telling me is that I can't just enjoy your service right now, I have to have more, and more, and more. So I have to have those little additional features or else I'm screwed? Better and better, and better and, fancier things, and fancier things and more, which is great for a seventy something year old, you know, because they don't need to have the stuff that they enjoy. They have to have digital cable, because you know, their eyes really tell the difference between regular cable and digital cable. 
Oh, and digital phone. That's a brilliant idea. More, and did you know what? Did you know that if you have digital phone, better, and power goes out, you can't call nine one one? More and better, isn't that fantastic? 
I learned in California when the power went out, we had all these blackouts -- these rolling blackouts, because we were being screwed by some power company, that when power goes out, you can't use a cordless phone, because it needs power in order to be used. 
But I still had a landline phone so I was the only person in my apartment complex that could call anybody and so I had lines out my apartment for people who needed to call people because I was the only one that actually had the working phone. And it's so great to know, the fact that my seventy something year old father now cannot call nine one one, because you know, nine one one is less likely to be used when there's some major catastrophe that may result in power going out for extended periods of time. And seventy something years old are you know, less likely to trip and fall when they're walking around in the dark. 
But the main point, this main point that has just been the straw that's broken this little camel's back is that I spent two days, two full days over there, setting up his email with the, the, the new -- 'cause I had to upgrade -- he had dial up so I had to upgrade his email as well as the, the, the internet access. 
So the internet access set up was great, no problem, but of course my seventy something year old father, who, who, when you get to that age, change is -- is -- is -- is -- is -- wants to use the same email program that he has been using for the past decade. 
Understandable, it takes him two years to get used to a program so he wants to use the same program and this program is so ancient that if it were a person, it would be like uh -- somebody that was in their prime in nineteen eighty three who is still trying to be that cool teenager, that just ends up looking like a moron, with big useless hair and ugly shoes. 
And after those two days -- two days, two days of doing this, I get him all set up, it was working beautifully. Well, I just found out, no more than ten minutes ago that my father, having a minor problem, called up customer service. Two days of forcing that program into a two thousand and nine bubble, all lost, lost, bye bye, all lost, in thirty seconds. 
Lost, by some girl, not knowing what the bleep she's doing, but can't admit that, she's too lazy and not paid enough to really care -- well she decided to have my father erase all of the accounts and use the wizard. Wow. Aren't you brilliant? Aww, use the wizard? I wouldn't of thought to try that. 
And oh, if I did think of trying to use the wizard and it worked, I think I would've said, ah, I rather set up everything manually. What's the fun in using the automatic wizard? When I can go through it manually, step by step, port by port, POP three by POP three until my brain melts and oozes down the back of my throat searing multiple holes through by stomach and leaks out my bellybutton, like flesh eating bacteria which then engulfs me like some geriatric cyberspace black hole on hemorrhoids. Woohoo, hemorrhoids, wow. 
And I can just see this girl, this Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie, whom, for some reason I picture as chewing bubble gum with newly manicured tacky fingernails shoved so far up her bum you can file them through her nose. Julie, not realizing that she is disintegrating the life span of some stranger by fifty years. Just like a drug pusher preying on innocent souls. 
No, it's okay, go ahead, delete it, it won't hurt anything, just delete all the accounts. It's okay. Oh Julie, how could you do this to me? And of course, she's doing this all with a giggle and a perky, sweet, sweet smile. Perkily concluding, well, I can't seem to fix your problem today, sir, you'll have to contact your system administrator. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 
You have no idea. Well, Julie, Julie, Julie, come to think of it, there is -- do you think I could get a lobotomy or is that considered an upgrade? . 
Oh, hey pumpkin you're -- aww, you are so fired.
