Hey, everybody. So um, pardon my appearance right now. It is actually freezing. Freezing, freezing, on top of freezing. I don't know if there's a cold front coming in or something like that, but it is cold. So I've decided to be safe and to wrap myself up, kinda like a burrito type thing and not come out unless absolutely necessary. 
But -- oh, sorry, adjust my -- my burrito. Um, I just received another comment and I know I had made videos about this a long time ago, but I guess it's best to do it again since I don't know when I'll be able to reload those videos and it's about dating in Japan. And of course dating in any country is something that can be complex or, I don't know -- into it especially a lot of young ladies that would like to come to Japan and would like to date. I mean, that's understandable. You're in a new country, why not? 
But, um, one of the questions that came up that was sent to me yesterday was talking about the difference between Japanese men and Western men and whether I've dated a Japanese guy before and what did I notice in differences when dating Japanese men. And I can't really answer that question. I've only dated one Japanese guy and that didn't work out and it was more personality differences than anything else and so that -- that happens with anyone. 
But from the women that I know that do date Japanese men and have been here a lot and very, very clear about the differences between Japanese men and Western men is affection. And I know in animes and in dramas and things like that you see -- you see an overwhelming amount of affection and you're like, oh, it's so cool, it's so dreamy, da da da da da. But regular Japanese guys aren't really like that, and for a Japanese guy that I do know, just talking about basic -- like, complimenting their girlfriends doesn't happen very often. 
Um, but with younger people now you'll see them holding hands and things like that, where you wouldn't see that before. So society is changing in that way when it comes to affection but that's something that's been very clear. 
Even when I dated um, a Japanese guy it was not as common to be complimented by him or to have, you know, that kind of affection, to be hugged, to be, um, admired, and things like that. And I'm not saying that Japanese men don't do it. I'm not. And even older women that I've talked to in my office, especially, um, because Bobby has come and he's visited and he is just a really friendly and affectionate guy, and I remember one day I was talking to my co worker and I was, like, Bobby called me a full time job. He said he has two full time jobs -- me and his nine to five. And so I was -- I was laughing to myself and then one of my co workers had said she wishes that her husband would say stuff like that, because Japanese men don't usually compliment, uh, Japanese women. Um, whether it be their style or their character or things like that, it's just not as common a thing. And for the women that she knows that date American men or European men or men from just other places in general, uh, she said that it's just not as common. And she wishes that her husband would -- would say things like that, but then she wouldn't know how to react because she's so accustomed to not hearing those kinds of things. 
And um, not to discourage anyone because you date who you want to, but finding um, a boyfriend or girlfriend -- actually, no, let me say a boyfriend because it's -- I've noticed that it's a lot easier for guys to find a girlfriend -- a Japanese girlfriend -- than it is for girls to find a Japanese boyfriend. But it is what it is and it depends on where you are, it depends on what your personality is like, but don't be discouraged. If you'd like to date while you're here, by all means. I encourage you to go out there and watch. Go places and watch how they interact with each other because that will tell you a lot about what exactly it is you're up against. 
And on top of that, you have to figure out what exactly you want before you go dating anybody, because if you don't know what you want then you're liable to fall for the okeydoke and you don't want to do that anywhere in life, anywhere, it doesn't matter where you are. So figure out what you want, what you don't want, and just watch. It may take a long time to find someone, but you never know. You might come across the love of your life or you might come across an experience that, you know, sets you up to find whoever it is that you're looking for later on. 
So yeah, I am reporting from under the -- the covers and I bought a heated blanket so I'm not freezing and I'm about to cover my head up and go to bed. So, I go to bed. It's a little early. What is it -- it's not even five o'clock yet. But it's cold, and I'm getting back under the covers. 
So I will see you all later.
