And if nothing else works, number ten will get them running for the hills. Well I can't, I'm reading Harry Potter. Sorry. 
Well kids, it's finally that time of year. The trees are pretty much bare, turkey flying off the shelves, oh, and my favorite part, it's New Moon season. 
If there's one thing you need to know about me, and please don't let this sway your decision for subscribing, I hate Twilight. It's not the books, it's fans, they're everywhere and they're obsessed and then when I pull out my wizard rock, they look at me like I'm a Martian. Dude, you have, I like boys who sparkle, monogrammed on your tote bag. 
So, no? I -- I don't know, people have been asking me a lot, Lauren, let's go see New Moon, it's gonna be so much fun if you wanna go Friday night, let's go see New moon. To which I respond, that sounds -- that sounds -- that sounds great but um, no, no, I'm not gonna go see New Moon. 
I wouldn't mind seeing it, I saw Twilight, not in theaters, but I saw it. And why, my dear friends? Because any time a vampire and or a shirtless werewolf talks, the whole crowd goes into hysterics. And I can tolerate quite a lot, but there's no way I'm gonna sit through that. 
But it got me thinking, I probably need some sort of excuse. So if you or a loved one are getting pressured in and going to see new Moon, luckily for you, I've combined a list of ten surefire ways to get out of it. 
I'm allergic to sparkles . I have a lot of reading to get done. I'm afraid of the dark. Man, I -- you know, I -- I really can't make it, I'm -- I'm having a community channel marathon, again. I need to keep re watching the AMTM finale until the right girl wins. Yeah, that one hasn't come on yet. Um, I promised my mom I'd wash the dog . Friday is bath night and I, uh -- in my house we fill up the tub by filling tablespoons with hot water. Shucks, I've got a game that night.
