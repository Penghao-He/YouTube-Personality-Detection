Hey there YouTube. I've just -- I've had a very rocky week -- rocky week, sorry, even I can't talk but, um, I just want to turn this video on because I want to alert the new AT&T and iPhone customers -- customers out there, about losing your iPhone. One, I don't recommend it. Two, I don't recommend it. Three, I don't recommend it. Why? Because you'll be charged up your ass and this is only for like the first year and a half customers here, before you get the upgrade so you can get this phone for a cheaper if you get another one on -- on your same account. So let's just -- let's just take a little story that happened to me this week. You all know I went to and somehow the planes just love my iPods and my iPhones because each time I leave there I don't come back with them. So they just -- so they just take it away from me. So, when I got back to my house I -- I was you know, looking over my stuff and seeing what was here and what wasn't and what I had to throw away. And I basically noticed I didn't have my iPhone with me. So I thought maybe I left it in my friend's car. So I call him. He looks -- not there. Now I panic. Um, and that's when I could not find it and that's when I realized that it was gone. I did ask my friend to take another good look at it, but it's not happening. So here I was, now without a phone, again. This is not the first time something bad happened to my iPhone, by the way, never jump into a pool with one. Um, so I'm with another iPhone, so all right, we'll wait until, you know, around Wednesday to get the new phone. 
So I go to the apple store on Wednesday and since there is no insurance on the iPhone, or at least the three G S model. Um, you can -- you're pretty much going to be paying out of your -- out of your pocket to get this new iPhone. 
So here it is, new iPhone with a new case, in case, I'll review it sometime. Um, I'm sure you've heard of all the in cases now. But, um, we go in there and they tell me to do that, uh, early, um, step and all that extra stuff that you do before you get a -- before you get a, um, new phone. So I do that and then I look at the prices. four hundred, five hundred, four ninety nine, five ninety nine, six ninety nine. So the UGS model, of course which is the most expensive, the one that has the thirty two gigabytes. Six ninety nine. Do you understand the numbers? Six hundred and ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents for a new iPhone. If you happen to have the same plan and buy a new iPhone. What the fuck? What the fuck? So, um, yeah. So that's when I -- me and my Mom took it through a shit store and, um, we went out of the store. We were looking for the HGV store and near the same area and they told us, yeah, that's -- that's the way it is and you almost just lost a customer. Um, now I do cancel my -- that's when I cancelled my account so I can get the phone cheaper by going to my mom's account. Now normally I wouldn't do that but, you know, I needed a phone and I don't want to use what we call a dumb phone. A dumb phone is like a normal -- normal cell phone. So I -- I did everything I could to get a new iPhone which I did. And, um, it's very bittersweet. 
So my story here and I'm -- I'm not blaming Apple or AT and T. Um, I was at first because, you know, I was so mad about the price and me losing my phone and it was just a mess. But I'm not blaming AT&T and Apple. They're gonna run out of business. But still, to jack up the prices to six ninety nine on the same account. Are you kidding me? And then offer an upgrade about a year and half later? That's a little shitty but, um, but it's not something I don't expect from Apple. I mean, I love Apple and everything but, you know, they have their bad things, you know. 
But I -- so this is just a quick video to tell you to watch out for your iPhone, 'cause you don't want to lose this in your first year on a contract with them. To break it and maybe go on someone else's plan and get a new phone, you don't want that. So I advise not to go on another person's plan unless it's a family member. That is the only time I will -- I could say, oh yeah. 'cause I did it. I'm not going to blame you if you don't do it and now. 
So -- so that's my story. Um, I did just get ODST. Um, I'm friends with the campaign first and I'll accept more invites for friends 'cause I do want to try out fire fighting. 
So -- so, yeah, that's my story guys. Um, work starts next week so videos will probably become a little bit more scarce. Now I'll try to do a video once in a while. I guess it will work out when I'm not at work. So I got the life thing and a new car which I'm gonna show and I want to post a new video for you guys. 
 I just got a new car. It's a Mitsubishi Lancer GTS two thousand and eight, so it's a very nice car. So um, just, uh, just be weary of losing your iPhone and, you know, all that stuff that happens when, you know, you lose a phone. I mean, losing a phone is tough but, um, but, you know, I mean, lose an i -- like an iPhone type of phone, it's gonna be even tougher. And AT and T and Apple don't make it any easier on your first year. Customer loyalty, yeah. Right now, I'm running out of stuff so I'm just cutting this video now, um, so yeah, , subscribe guys. Um and I'll talk to you soon. Take it easy.
