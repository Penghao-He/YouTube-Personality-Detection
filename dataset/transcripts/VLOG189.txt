Hey guys, it's XXXX. I know it's been a while since I updated. I'm sorry, I have just been so, so busy. Um, I think I mentioned in my last post that my company is going through a system conversion, and that's been not a nightmare, but just -- just extremely busy. I'm working twelve hour days and it's been, um -- it's been torture. But, I've been making it through. Um, this year my daughter also started high school, so I've been very busy, um, with her as well. But, everything's going good, you know. 
Um, let's see -- as far as my update, you just say me weighing myself in. So as of today, September thirteenth, I weigh two seventy one. Um, so that's a total of forty four pounds lost. Um, I'm extremely happy with that. Um, September ninth I celebrated my three months, um, since getting the on June ninth. And, so that's forty four pounds in three months, so that's pretty good and I'm happy with that. 
Um, let's see -- as far as what size I wear, I was wearing a twenty four. Now I'm a solid twenty, but I -- I am getting into some eighteens, um, depends on where I buy 'em from. Ashley Stuart I could wear an eighteen lean brown, I can an eighteen. Entorit , I still wear a twenty. I'm still pretty top heavy. I'm still pretty wide across here, so I'm still wearing an eighteen twenty. Um, you know twenty shirts up here, but my bottoms are getting, um -- are getting smaller. So, um, I need to really start focusing on upper body exercises. I do a lot of cardio, but the cardio is really working on my lower body so, um, need to concentrate on that. 
Anyway, um, I got my second fill on September fourth, and now I have good restriction. I, uh, let's see -- I have fourteen cc van , and on my first fill I got three ccs put in, and it didn't give me much restriction. So, I noticed that kind of right away as soon as I started eating solid food. So I made an appointment to get another fill, and that fill happened on Sep four. So, um, he added two ccs, and so that made a total of five. And I actually felt it tightening up. It felt like a little mild stinging heartburn. And I was like, wow, I didn't feel the first one -- this is weird, you know. Um, so I went out to the waiting room and started sipping on some water and got a lot of pressure in my chest, and a lot of hiccups -- I mean it was terrible, all for a sip of water. So I knew it was too tight and, um, it's funny because I actually knew it was too tight based off what I've heard people here on YouTube and on, um, the Obesity Help Board mention -- how you feel when you're too tight. And so I knew right away and, um, I told them -- hey it's too tight, you gotta take some out. So he took out one cc. So, it's funny because three ccs didn't do anything for me and five was too much. So now I have four ccs and it's perfect restriction. 
Um, and because I have good restriction, now I'm really concentrating on only eating good stuff. Because, since my portion size has, um, significantly decreased, I can only, um, take in so much. I have to make sure that those are good foods for me. So this last week and a half since I got my fill -- pretty much only meats and vegetables. And I do like a grilled chicken pattie, maybe half of that. And um, uh, maybe a fourth of a cup of vegetables and I'm good. Um, it's funny though because what I have to do, um -- I'm sorry, go back to that. Chicken and vegetables and that's it. I don't eat any kind of carbs. No pasta, no rice, no sugars. Um, I do eat some fruits, but that is pretty much about it. I don't have time for anything else. If I get in the mood to eat something, it's gonna have to be, you know, a piece of lunch meat or something like that -- something that's gonna give me some kind of vitamin or some kind of protein. I don't waste my time with anything else. Um, I'm still working on drinking my calories, though, because I do drink a lot of teas and lemonades and things like that, and I need to get rid of that. 
Um, one thing I have noticed, though, that I need to get my brain to start appreciating, let's say, is the fact that the full sensation you get with the lap band is not necessary a satisfying full feeling. Um, before when you had hunger and you would eat something you weren't hungry anymore, it was a satisfying -- okay, finally I ate, I'm good. The lap band -- it's kind of just a red light or indicator that you need to stop eating, because it fills you up, it fills that pouch and if you eat anymore, you're gonna have a lot of pain. So, it's kind of like one of those -- like I said, stoplights, but it's not a satisfying, like, pleasurable feeling. It's kind of uncomfortable -- not extremely painful, but just a little uncomfortable. So, um, before you eat too much to get it painful, like I said, just stop and push away from the plate. Um, so because I know that the weight is coming and the lap band is actually working for me, I'm trying to get my mind to appreciate that feeling and not search for that satisfying, you know, bottom of the stomach, you know, feeling. 
Uh, my head hunger is getting better. Um, I don't graze but, um, when I do feel the need to want to munch on something, I will grab, um, some fruit or a little thing of apple sauce or some sugar free jello or something like that. Um, I just don't grab the bad stuff anymore. Um, I do Baby Bell -- little cheeses and stuff like that. That tends to help. Again, anything that has protein in it, I'll go ahead and do it. 
Um, let's see. I mentioned that I was an -- size twenty, size eighteen, so I'm gonna back up and let you see my new size eighteen skinny leg jeans in a second. But before I do that, I want to tell you guys, um, I think I showed in an early, early video um, the Special K protein water -- the little bottles. They now have the little mix in packets, and you get ten packets in here for the same price of getting, I think, four or six pre made bottles. So it's better cost savings, um, for this, and they're really cool. Um, so I actually hadn't had the pink lemonade. I think I may try it tonight. Um, but, yeah, they're pretty good. Got it at Walmart so, um, yeah, there you go. 
Anyway, so that's the gist of my update. I'm gonna back up now so you can see new in my new jeans and um, you guys take care of yourself. I'll talk to y'all later.
