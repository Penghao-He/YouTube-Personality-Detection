I worked through retro --
You want to go to a dirty overpriced dung palace? You go to a restaurant. When your mom is too lazy to cook, restaurant. When you dad burns his Stouffer's in the microwave, restaurant. 
One thing I have to ask for all those restaurant owners; why is it that there is always under cooked meat? Come on, it looks like the inside of my mouth. Ew. Why is there always dirty floors? Like, I went to a CiCi's Pizza and, literally, it looked like a concert underneath my table. Coke bottles everywhere, little bit of blood and mud. And I sit there and wait forever for food; I mean I always end up with undercooked meat anyway so why does it take you so damn long?
