Like that, yeah. So what have I been up to? Converted to Pastafarianism. Got a partner who lost the ability to sleep at night. Got a ShamWow. Got a partner. Got all of my traveling plans for Canada and Peru cancelled. My partner found out that I actually needed to get a job. Did I mention that I have a partner? Yeah, I did. I got a partner. Um, if you noticed the -- the banner on my page right now, is, uh, Justin -- and that would be Boldy -- a very good friend of mine. And this month is actually Boldy Appreciation Month, when a bunch of us are appreciating Boldy and giving him as much attention on YouTube as we can, because he deserved it and he's awesome .

Um, and they were -- I've been to my campus, like, a few times. Lost, every single time. I don't -- I have such a know where I'm going. 
Hi YouTube, I'm kind of squished in here right now, but that's not important. What is important is that I'm actually making a blog, but in this blog I'm going to be talking a lot, an awful lot about myself. I know; I don't know if you would call it an update, but it's your call. So in order to make it bearable for both of us I'm going to insert clips of my dog, because he's adorable. 
ï»¿Okay, bye.
