Hey guys. So don't ask why I'm in the bathroom right now and not in the studio, 'cause I'm just not gonna explain it right now. Maybe I'll -- I'll just describe it later on why. Anyway, so I want to make a video about how awesome uh, Zed Two's Picks or Beshie or however you know him -- how awesome he is and how much he rules, because let's face it, that guy rocks, right? So, I wanted to tell you how awesome he is and why I think he rules.
