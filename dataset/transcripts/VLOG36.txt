Mmm. It is so freaking hot here, my armpits smell like a at the concert. There, I said it dad. And it's not as hot as Darwin but at least in Darwin most people have air conditioners and you can sleep at night without sweating. At the moment I'm working on a remix for Witlee, it's a competition and if I win I get twelve months worth of free entry into all due process concerts or whatever, I don't know what it is. But, I'm going to win it. I'm competitive now. I decided that yesterday. We'll see if I can eat this ice cream before it'll melt. Can I eat it up? I see a lot of, um, those commercials on TV for ABC three starting on December fourth. It makes me feel sad but also very happy for people who got the jobs. It will be awesome. If there any ABC three people who are watching, I'm in Sydney and I need a job. Yeah, I actually live two streets down from the ABC building and I go past there every day on my way to school and go huh. I have thought of infiltrating the place wearing a lobster suit but then my sister told me lobsters are dangerous looking so why not dress as a bear. Although I think bears are rather dangerous, depending on the kind of bear. My last bit of ice cream. That was good, that was really good, actual gelato in fact. I got it from the farmers market across the road. Why not listen to the remix, I'll show it to you. Lets rock. Play it please. . "We are here/it seems we are always marching/ it seems dark like here/Nothing ever seems so clear so clear . " Well that wasn't a real phone call. I was just making the whole thing but, you know. You thought it was real didn't you? Anyway let me know what you think of the remix, it's just like about a minute of it but I really don't know what to do next. I have a feeling that's the end of the song but I made it first so I really don't know what to choose for the beginning. I'm good making things from end to front. No it's not. You may have noticed that there's no what's on anti news things today, I feel lazy today so there's not going to be one. There wasn't one last week though so there's not going to be one this week. But there will be one next week, maybe. Or I must just have one special one for it, if something completely ridiculous happens in the town in that time. Like that time that there was a three hundred person brawl in Katarina Square . I actually went and looked it up and it was only thirty people but my sister told me it was three hundred people. I would hold her to that because it sounds way more epic. . Yeah that was totally awesome.
