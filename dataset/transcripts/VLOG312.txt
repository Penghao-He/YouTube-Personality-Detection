And also, hopefully, our friends XXXX and XXXX will be making videos shortly. They have both expressed an interest, so I'm just waiting on them to make them. Bye from Florida. Bye. 
Do you feel self conscious? 
Yes. 
ï»¿So, as most of you know, by now, I'm moving to Boston and, well, in about twenty four hours. And today is technically my birthday - it's after midnight and it is June twenty fourth, so happy birthday. I am twenty seven today and tomorrow at six in the morning, I am flying up to Boston and that's pretty exciting. I have been in Florida for about three months now. Things obviously didn't workout here so I am just calling it a three month vacation in Florida, which is certainly better than most, ah, people get to experience. Ah, the next two days are probably going to be pretty boring --
Lazy head and sleepy bones always disagree though everybody says that they should be--
I have nothing to do here in Florida. My friend Jake has arrived and he's been keeping me company for my birthday, so that has been wonderful. So that's it for my blog update. No one has given me a dare yet, so I won't be doing one this blog. However, I have been told to, ah, punish Pam for taking so long to do her last dare. Unfortunately, I couldn't really think of a punishment that wouldn't involve you running around naked, so instead I am just going to give you another dare to do since it is not your turn, so now you are going to have to do two dares in a short amount of time which is sort of like a punishment. So Pam, your dare -- ah, I am actually going to give you a choice of two and which ever one you don't do I think I am going to have Molly do the other one. You can either make a music video -- just do something poppy -- do something that we would not expect from you that would be hilarious. That's your dare. Or since I know that you were recently in a show where you had to play a Ukrainian cooking show host or something or
what you were. Ah, I would like you to prepare a dish and show us how to do it. I want you to put a little cooking show together, but I want it an actual working recipe so that when you make it everyone else can, you know, know how to do it. So, this is going to be my final one from Florida, ah, from the garage, how glamorous, I know. Ah, that's it. Ah, so Pam, get on the dare and if you don't, I am going to punish you with another dare, so get on it.
