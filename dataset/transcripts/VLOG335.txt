Good morning, YouTube. It's Sunday, the twenty sixth of April and it's ninety one degrees outside. Oh, that's bad. 
But I want you to meet my -- my very best friend. Yeah, it's mister air conditioner and -- and thanks to mister air conditioner, can I just say it's quite jokes it's quite jokes in here; although running my AC is bringing up the atmosphere, it's quite jokes. 
It's ninety one degrees in April in New Jersey. 
Was that the doorbell? I'll see you tomorrow in case it was.
