Hey guys, it's Friday the thirteenth, and apparently Friday the thirteenth isn't a bad omen this time, um, because just got something in the mail and it's from XXXX. I knew she was sending it, but like, I was hoping it would get here, um, Thursday but it didn't, it just got here today. 
So, I'm gonna open it, and I looked on the back and you probably can't read that, but if you can, uh, the whole, uh, what would you do, the is kinda like an inside joke between the two of us, and it made me smile when I saw it. I was like eeeh. 
So, I'm going to open it. Find out what is inside. I know one of things, but it -- it feels thicker than I thought it would be. Oh geez, all kinds of little fun things in here. That's the look of a confused person. Okay, let's see. 
Oh, she told me she was writing a little letter. Thank you, you're adorable XXXX and I love you. She got me a Leakycon 2011 pen. She told me about that. Oh you know what, they were actually giving the -- ironically enough -- they were actually giving these booklets out to people, um, at Leakycon two thousand and nine, but now I have two. Oh, that's so fun. But wait, that makes me smile. 
And Bill's CD. Aww, I'm so excited. Bill is awesome. Ooh, hello CD. The little things inside broke, that's sad, that's why it popped out. That's okay, the case broke but the CD looks okay. Little piece of a case. And Bill signed it. I say I wish you could've come soon. Scribble. I'm pretty sure it says Bill Martin, but it -- it -- it looks like a little scribble. His -- his handwriting is a lot neater than Hank's is, though, so Bill wins on that front. The case broke, but the CD looks okay, that's okay. As long as the CD's okay, that's really the most important part. 
XXXX, thank you for this. That was really sweet of you, you're awesome and I love you. And I can't wait to listen to the CD and I have to find a good place for this pen, I don't know where. Gotta go somewhere though, 'cause I wanna be there. Aww, that was really sweet of you, thank you very much, you're adorable, thank you. Um, I really appreciate it and I will talk to you soon. 
But you know what the weird part is? Is the fact that the part that made me happiest was that it was from California and that XXXX touched it. Good times.
