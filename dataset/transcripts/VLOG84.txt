I know, the pink is almost gone, but don't worry, it's coming back soon. Hey guys, this is just a quick update video, I'll make, like, real videos again soon, but, uh, these are some important things that you gotta know. First of all, my, uh collab channel with my cousin is doing some really interesting stuff starting this coming week. Uh, and it's going to be exciting, and you should check it out. So, the link to that will be in the sidebar, and also right here, that's our channel - so go subscribe and check that out. Secondly, my other cousin XXXX just started making videos, and she's really cute and her videos are really cute, and she doesn't have a lot of subscribers, and she's cute, so she should. I hope she doesn't mind me calling her cute this many times. I am three years older than her. So, go check her out as well. Um, also in the sidebar, and also right here. And go subscribe to her. 
One last thing, and the most important. I am going to be on XXXX tomorrow at seven Eastern Standard Time, seven o'clock pm, um, with my friend XXXX, aka XXXX, not XXXX, and most likely -- I'm not sure if this was confirmed or not -- my friend XXXX who is XXXX, um, we're gonna be on XXXX, and we're gonna have a lot of fun, and it's all of our first time on XXXX and there's probably going to be music. Um, I have a bunch of songs that I haven't actually put on my YouTube channel that I may play for you. Um, original songs. Um, there may be readings from our novels that we were all just working on, there may be - there will probably be lots of stupid jokes, um, it's gonna be a good time. So you should come, because it's going to be exciting, and, um, that's tomorrow at seven o' clock. This is in celebration of Lauren and I both reaching a hundred subscribers -- actually we're both past it now - but it's exciting, and we want to thank you so we're doing this XXXX show, aaand, so you should come. 
Okay that's all I have to say, bye. Actually, there's just one more thing that I forgot to tell you, and that is, um, oh -- oh my -- what?
