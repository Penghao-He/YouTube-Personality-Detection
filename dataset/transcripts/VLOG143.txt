﻿Hi, and welcome back to my video blog. This is a new series that I want to start called, uh, the XXXX. Um, I love ya. Um, I've -- I discussed with some people about the title and some of you have said that being an atheist doesn't really change who you are and that is true. I'm not an atheist. Atheist is not a label you can put on someone. Besides, it's a lack -- uh, it's not a lack of belief -- it's a non belief in God or gods, uh, which doesn't tell anything else other than that. But by saying that, this is because a lot of religious people out there -- a lot I personally as well have met -- have said that atheists are amoral, uh, have bad ethics, uh, and all in all are bad people. 
So now we're going to take this from the perspective of a parent and talk about what it is to be a parent. Uh, you didn't hear me ask me any questions irreligious or regarding parenting for -- for this series. 
Uh, I am a father to a boy that is two years old now. Uh, he was born in two thousand seven. I'm twenty three years old, so I was, uh, twenty one when he was born. Uh, some -- some would call that a young parent -- I don't really regard myself as being young, but I know that I'm young in the sense that I'm not old. Uh, but I'm not so young that I can't take responsibility, uh, by, uh, responsibility -- responsibility for the upbringing of a child and be there as a parent for him. Um, so yeah. 
Sorry, I'm still a bit sick. My son is at his mother's place. We broke up, uh, a while ago, you can look back in my video blogs to figure out when it is. Uh, we're still communicating as friends and we -- we switch with him, having him a week each, and this is my week off, um, because I've got work this weekend. I can't really have a boy of two years old running around at home alone while Daddy is at work. 
Um, but anyway. How does being atheist come in, uh, when it comes -- regard -- when it comes to parenting? Um, I don't really think that it comes down -- uh, it doesn't really affect the child as much, uh, besides the fact that I think religious people are trying to push their dogma and belief onto their children -- basically brainwashing them or indoctrinating. 
Um, you could say the same thing about politics. Uh, I would never push, uh, my political views onto my son. Uh, I don't think that would be possible because my ex girlfriend, uh, is on the other political -- well, she's not the same political view as I do. I'm very liberal -- uh, yeah, liberal socialist. Anyway, uh, but being an atheist doesn't mean you have bad moral or a total lack of moral or no morals at all or no ethics. Uh, morals are basically -- there are a lot of videos explaining why you can have a moral without believing in God. God's not necessary for there to be moral. Uh, morality, uh, simplified, is basically, uh, social, uh, decisions with social interactions. Uh, I think fifty four talked about it in one of their videos. That morality be bumped. 
Uh, what I want to teach my child is respect for other people. Respect to people regardless of their age, ethnicity, race, political views, or religious views. And by that said, I know --
