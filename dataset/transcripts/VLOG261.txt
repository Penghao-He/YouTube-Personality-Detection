Hi guys. So I put up two singing vlogs like, earlier. Um, Battlefield, by Jordan Sparks, and -- -- Your Raise Me Up, Josh Groban, sorry. So, uh, this is the third one, Signed, Sealed, Delivered. You see me coughing, that's why I'm wearing this. Like a fool I went and stayed too long. Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong, oh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Then that time I went and said goodbye, now I'm back and not ashamed to cry, oh, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Here I am, baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. Don't you know that here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. I've done a lot of foolish things that I really didn't mean. I've got a . Don't you know that I'm your only man. Seen a lot of things in this old world. 
When I touch them, they mean nothing girl, ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. Ooh, baby, you set my soul on fire, that's why I know you are my heart's only desire, ooh baby, 'cause here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. Don't you know, here I am, baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. Don't you know, here I am, baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. Thank you.
