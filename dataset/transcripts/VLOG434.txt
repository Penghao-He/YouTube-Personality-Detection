Posing as a Palestinian born Muslim suffering from Israeli oppression. Interestingly enough, he was later exposed as a Christian, born in Cairo, so what he was up to I still don't know. Here comes the full circle. Edward Saed has a very good friend. He wrote a forward for a book that dis -- he described as very much necessary reading. The book is titled Fugitive Days, and the author -- you'll never guess -- yup, if you recognize this thug, it is William Ayers, who has pretty much faded from spotlight, but I think we should bring him back, because Obama continually plays him down. But as we see, there is much more to Ayers than most people even realize. In fact, I'd probably pose more questions than answers. But the way I see it, is on some very powerful people with some very dangerous motives, have groomed, and launched Obama into the spotlight. He has deep Muslim ties, and the fact that he accomplished nothing, other than run for president, should make every American stop --
-- The capital and other buildings. He's never apologized. 
But thi - this is an example of what I'm talking about. Uh, this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago. Uh, who I know and who I have not, uh, received some official endorsement from. He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis. 
Oh, I'm such a shit. 
I figured this was a shut case; someone was smearing Obama, and that was it. But, not so fast. The Sutton family, actually contacted by newsnet. com surprisingly said that Kevin Wardally is not a spokesman for the family, but actually a player in Harlem politics and someone challenging Sutton for the position. They denied any links to Wardally, who did not even get Sutton's age right. Apparently Sutton was actually 88, not 86. 
So what about Obama's campaign officially denying Obama knowing Al Mansour? Well, get this; Al Mansour himself admitted he knew Obama, further saying in an interview with newsnet. com, again -- involved in any way in celebrity sweepstakes. I wish him well. Anything I can do, if he'll let me know, I'll let him know what I think I can do or can't. But I don't collect autographs. I wish him the best, and hope he can win the election. 
Nineteen eighties, Al Mansour gave lectures at -- including in places like Columbia University. I suspect they met there. But who is Al Mansour, and why should we even care? Jeremiah Wright, move over. You ain't got nothin' on this guy. Check out the impressive resume. Well known in the black community as a lawyer, an orthodox Muslim, a Black Nationalist -- he mentored Huey Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party -- an educator, politically outspoken hater of Israel -- all the Jews who support Obama, pay attention -- and an author, with works that include, I quote, The Lost Books of Africa Rediscovered, where he illustrates how United States was planning to perform genocide against black Americans; The Destruction of Western Civilization as Seen Through Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, and Americans, Beware: The Zionist Plot Against Saudi Arabia. It still doesn't make any sense. 
What is Al Mansour, one of the most connected, well known, black Muslims in the world, have to do with Obama? Well actually, he does. Jack Cashill from WorldNetDaily wrote an article by the name of " Candidates. " Interesting title, I must admit. And Al Mansour has a friend, or used to have a friend, named Edward Said, an author and apparently somewhat of a terrorist sympathizer due to his very left like leanings. Well Al Mansour and Said have connections to the publishing world. In Columbia, Obama attended some of his lectures where they became friends apparently, because there is a photograph floating around of a 1998 Arab American dinner --
