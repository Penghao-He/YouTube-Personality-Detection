Now after you have all that all in the same bowl, you're gonna beat on low, with egg beaters obviously, and you're going to beat this mixture on low, until a dough begins to form. And once the dough forms, you'll know that it's ready when you squeeze the dough with your fingers and it sticks together. 
That means it's time to make the cookie shapes. 
﻿Hi, again and today I am gonna show you how to make some chocolate gem cookies -- and it's actually another Martha Stewart recipe, but it's really, really good so I thought I'd share it with you guys. 
And what you'll need for this recipe is two cups of flour, a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and the one I got was Hershey's because, I dunno, Hershey's was pretty sweet. Um, you'll also need one fourth cup of unsweetened cocoa powder so that's -- if I didn't say that, that's what you need and one fourth teaspoon of salt. 
And you'll also need a cup which is two sticks of unsweet-- unsalted butter at room temperature -- it has to be softened -- and three fourths cup of sugar and one teaspoon pure vanilla extract. 
Now that first step that we have to do in order to make these cookies is sift the flour and the salt and the cocoa powder -- remember three fourth cups -- all into one bowl to make this awesome powdery mixture. And I don't own a sifter, so I'm gonna kind of like, you know, go a little crazy and try to whisk it to you know -- a powder mixture. I hope this works, so -- it'll work I'm . 
So if you don't have a sifter you can just whisk it and with that always make a mixture. Just mix it together. Now the next thing you're gonna do is put your two sticks of unsweetened butter in this bowl and mix it until it's fluffy and like, on medium for about two minutes. 
After you've done mixing the butter together to make it all fluffy that's all you need. I've finished with a spoon because you're supposed to mix with a paddle, but I don't have a paddle so I finished with a spoon. And it's supposed to look kind of like this, really fluffy and soft. 
You add the three fourths cup of sugar and continue mixing for another two --
