I've been on YouTube for two years. That's what it tells me, at least. And I realized that two years is a long time of just watching videos, just watching. I've kept a live journal for like, forever, since I was in middle school. And it was good, it was one step closer to discovering who I was, 'cause I'm a creative writer -- it's, it's what I do, but I realized that text was a mask. The pretty words and the pretty metaphors were just a mask I was putting up for myself and I realized that the only way I could really, truly know myself is by looking at myself, watching myself talk. 
And a lot of your own videos inspired me to do that. It was you that got me into vlogging. I've always kinda wanted to but you convinced me that -- that words only got me so far. Text was hiding behind the screen of my monitor. I think it was that vlog you did, dealing with depression, I loved that one, that one really spoke to me. 
And you're right -- you know, and I don't always understand your videos, sometimes they could just fly over my head, but I've never bitched about it. You know, the reason why I'm subscribed to you is, like, it's because every time you post a video, I feel -- I wonder if I'll understand you this time. You know, with every video you post, I hope that I'll understand this one, maybe this one will get me closer to understanding you. So thank you. Thanks.
