Hi, um, so the other day my brother IM'd me, and he's like, 'your videos are , and I was like, 'what do you mean ? ' And so anyway, I'll -- , means your, -- um, mini Japanese lesson -- um, means, embarrassing. So, I was like, what do you mean it's embarrassing, Scott? And he's like, oh no, no, no, I don't mean that you -- you embarrass me or anything, but I would never post something like that of myself'. So, I was like whatever, dude, um, I'm not embarrassed. 
And, ah, Cindy my, ah, co worker, friend, so I told her about the blog and she, she checked them out and today she told me that, um, I like, flirt with the camera. She's like, you're not like that in real life, I was like, um, well you don't -- you know, like, people have different dimensions to their personality. And she's like yeah, true, but then when do I get to see that dimension of you? So, I don't know, like, I thought about it, um, and I guess maybe it does seem like I'm flirting with the camera, because it's such an intimate setting. Like, it's like me, and the camera, and romantic music playing in the background, so yeah, maybe. Like, I don't try to flirt; I don't think I'm flirting right now. 
Um, anyway, so this song is, um, my favorite, like, Hawaiian rendition, um, of -- this one is, um, Tracy Chapman's Baby Can I Hold You Tonight, by Aleya . I think it's really nice, it reminds me of, like, summer, the first time, the years I lived in Hawaii, how much I loved it. 
Um, so anyway, um, today I went to Wholefoods and I bought some ingredients, because I'm going to make, um, spicy sausage, eggplant, arrabbiata pasta. So, like normally, like, I usually make um, -- whenever I make pasta I always make arrabbiata, because that's the only thing I can make that tastes good. So, last time I made it, I, um, made my own noodles, so. I got -- I get really into things like that. So I made my own noodles from flour, and scratch, and then, I like, you know, cut strips -- we're using a pizza roller, but they turned out really irregular. 
So I, um, went to cooking. com and ordered a pasta maker, but um, I haven't used it; I ordered it, like, four months ago. Which reminds me, that I share the same character trait as my father, where like, you know, we get really into our interests and go all out and then suddenly, like, you know, we're not interested in it anymore. 
So, I remember a couple of years ago, my dad bought, ah, a pasta maker, too. But Papa, you never used that thing, I've never seen you use it, so ah, yeah. And also -- oh yeah -- my father, ah, sent me a message saying, you know, that I shouldn't quit my day job, but he liked my videos, unlike my brother. And, he, he suggested that him and I do one some time in the future. So, I would like to do that, and also make pasta together. But it's kind of hard because he lives in Japan and I live in San Francisco, also, but maybe next time we see each other, we can make homemade pasta, and do videos. 
Okay, bye bye.
