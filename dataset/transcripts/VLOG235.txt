This weekend I'm going to the New York City Anime Festival. What is that? It's basically an anime convention. And I've been to a few of these, so I've decided to file this video for tips and tricks to have a wonderful kind of experience. 
First off is money. It's going to cost money for the tickets. I personally get a weekend pass, so you can go the whole weekend. For Manga Day, you're going to need probably more money or less money depending on the convention prices and the city. I usually set aside an extra twenty bucks, so I can get a t shirt. 
Transportation is also going to run you some money. Since we're in Manhattan, I can take the subway out there and then hop on a bus and be there in no time. I go there twice a day; that's two twenty five with a transfer, so that's only four fifty a day. I got to put about -- between something about a fifteen dollar metro card --
A lot of free stuff, so bring a bag. I have a bag that I use just for this kind of thing, I have a small tin in it, which I use, cause I have a lot of business cards, a lot of small stickers, bookmarks, stuff like that, 'cause this -- they will give -- usually have bags you can get for free, but I prefer --
Cause a lot of this stuff -- 'cause this is going to be pretty cool. So, I recommend bringing a camera. I'm bringing a camera -- I'm gonna carry -- I'm gonna carry my camera in this bag; hold it around my neck. So, with your camera in mind, you're gonna need batteries, because the batteries might die or you might friend of your's he might need them, so I -- I try to purchase a twelve pack for the con. Also, a memory card wouldn't hurt -- I plan to bring my spare memory card, in case this one gets full up, 'cause you will be doing a lot of pictures and I plan on doing some filming this weekend. 
Now, you're going to get hungry. You're walking around all day, you're gonna get hungry. Now there's food there usually -- it's pretty fucking expensive there, so I'm gonna make -- so I would recommend making sandwiches or filling up a glad bag -- chips, trail mix, Power Bars, granola bars, pretzels maybe, stuff like that. Or for me -- now where I'm going there's a McDonalds two blocks away, I go there. You'll find people from the con there; trust me. You can get a quick -- quick lunch, head back to the convention, that's, of course, if you are willing to leave the convention center for it. 
Also, bring a bottle a water, it's going to be hot in there, there's a lot of people. Well, I guess that's about it. Um, if you have any more tips or tricks, leave a comment or a video response telling me and everyone else who watches this.
