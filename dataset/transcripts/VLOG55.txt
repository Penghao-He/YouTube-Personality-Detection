All right. I have strep, hence I have been doing a lot of window watching, creeping on people, you know; and what I have noticed is that girls, at least in my college, don't really care to wear pants. Man, even though it's fifteen degrees out; and there's eight inches of snow on the ground; and then they complain about being too cold. Put pants on and don't complain about freezing your ass off, because it is just hanging out there. That's all I have to say. Put pants on, because somebody, from their fourth floor window, that has strep might hear you and post this on YouTube.
