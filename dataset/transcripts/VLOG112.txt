Hey, guy. Good night, everyone. This is so unfair, um, it is after midnight here and actually I had intended to just go to sleep and make a video tomorrow maybe, but after reading my comments and my private messages and reading the comments on my channel I just had to say hello. Hello. 
The reason why I didn't make a video any sooner was because my weekend is occupied with car problems. As you know, I have a small car and I travel long distances; I travel a lot all over Holland and my car has been giving me trouble for I think a month now. Every time I go on the highway it will just start shaking and the garage couldn't find out what was wrong, but now they do know it's the gas pump and it's going to cost me a lot of money, but that isn't what I wanted to tell you. 
What I wanted to tell you, first of all, is thank you for the comments and for, well, making me feel like I'm being heard and that is wonderful; and that is going to be my message today; to keep on trying; always keep on trying, even when you think that what you are doing is not worth it. 
A teacher of mine asked me two weeks ago, what it was that I wanted to -- what the message was that I wanted to give to people -- or not the message not so much, but the impression I wanted to leave on people. I've thought about it for two entire weeks and I couldn't come up with an answer. I couldn't. I thought I wanted people to like me and therefore usually I hide and say nothing. I thought if I'd be quiet and just accept everything, people would like me. This YouTube experience has taught me that that is not the case. People will always comment on how my nose looks wrong or my overall face is not good today or -- and it's not my goal to be liked. 
I want to defend people who cannot voice what they have to say and are silent. And usually the silent ones are the ones with great opinions and I think they need to be acknowledged -- and that is what I hope to do, to acknowledge everyone who has his or her pretty opinions or strong devotions or dreams or hopes or aspirations. 
I think most people are very beautiful. I'm not talking about outside opinions; I'm talking about inside. For so long I felt I wasn't being heard and you often made me feel like I am -- and that I'm actually portraying something good. And now I know what it is that I want to leave people. 
I want people to think of me as someone who acknowledges -- who understands; and I hope you think I'm actually succeeding; and I hope that you know that you mustn't give up like I haven't given up on me, on anorexia, on young people. People should be who they are and you should be who you are; and no matter how rude comments are, I will always be XXXX, and not someone else, but you guys can only give me more self esteem; give me more courage; give me more -- make me believe in myself more, but not less; definitely not less. 
I don't easily get moved by much, but you have moved me. So I just wanted you to know that I thank you very much, and I wish you all a good night.
