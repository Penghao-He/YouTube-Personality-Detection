Hey guys. It is week number three into my weight loss journey. I hope you guys are still interested. Ah anyway, I wanted to talk to you guys about my past weight loss. So let's get started. I made a little weight loss timeline and also graphs because I'm a nerd. So I made a little weight loss time line. Here it is. Okay, so I am a baby over here and then basically what I have learned is that every time I move to a new state, I gained weight. So I lived in Texas when I was a baby up until when I was twelve years old, we moved to Ohio. I gained weight because that's a really stressful time. You're trying to make friends. You don't have any friends. It's just stressful. Twelve months later, no, it was sixteen, we move to Minne"snow"ta, right over here, oh right here. So that caused some weight gain too because, ha ha, I just made some friends in Ohio and then we had to leave so I comforted my pain with food, okay, and then over here I went to college in Wisconsin"sin, " as my sister would call it, and that caused some weight gain because that's college, stressful. As you also saw on my timeline, I had World War One and World War Two, not exactly. Um, I had weight watchers one and weight watchers two. 
Okay, so, take the challenge, get a pedometer, if you want, um, they are wonderful to help you lose weight. Um, they recommend you; if you want to stay fit you walk six thousand to eight thousand steps a day. If you want to lose weight they recommend that you walk about ten thousand steps a day in which part of those ten thousand steps, I think you have to walk -- walk four thousand in one go -- so, a big walk. Um, that's basically what I'm going to be doing. I'm going to be trying to get to ten thousand every day -- except for today since I just picked this up. They are not very expensive. This one was seven dollars at WalMart. There were five dollar ones but this one I opted for because it has this little strap. Because I have bought so many in the past that I -- they fall off and I lose them so this will catch it if it tries to fall off of me. So I'm going to try to walk ten thousand steps starting tomorrow. It will be awesome. Um, next week, however -- I might not have this video up on time. It's going to be a little late, probably a lot late. I'm going to be driving back to school next week. It will be awesome. I'm going, uh -- the problem is my school is ten hours away from here, although it will probably be twelve hours when you count Chicago traffic, weather and everything else. So, I am going to go which ever day is going to give me the best driving conditions, um, depending on the Indiana toll way and the most of Wisconsin. So that's that. It will probably be a day late, so -- because I'm thinking I'm going to go head out on Monday. So yeah, um, I want to hear how you guys -- you guys have been. If weather has been great or if you new to this, to say hi. I would love that. That's about it. I will see you guys next week and have a wonderful week.
