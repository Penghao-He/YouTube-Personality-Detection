About a year ago, Jerry H. Cooke started a meme -- well, kind of a meme -- called In My Lifetime and I'm late, but I'm gonna do it now. 
I will make good grades in college and eventually transfer to the University of Oregon. I want to have a career that really makes a difference in the world and helps other people. I want to meet all of the wonderful people that I've made friends with over the years. I want to stay friends with everyone that I'm friends with right now. Maybe that's not realistic, but we can try. 
I want to stop being so shy. I need to be able to approach other people and make friends and be friendly and social. I want to fall in love with one person and get married and have a happy family and beat the odds and not end in divorce. I want to meet and hang out with other nerdfighters. I want to continue making videos regardless of whether I have a high view count or subscriber count. I want to be a person my dad can be proud to call his daughter. I want it to stop raining and I want to learn to play the ukulele. 
Partly through filming it started raining really hard, so sorry if there's, like, pelting sounds. 
If you want to post your responses, post them to jerryhcooke's video which I will link in the sidebar which is probably that way since I pointed that way. 
Bye.
