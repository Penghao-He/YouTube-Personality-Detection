Okay, so I'm trying something new. I don't know if anybody is going to walk in honestly. They're all asleep, I think. is not here anymore, so I'm like looking around the camera at myself in the mirror. That's very weird. 
Obviously . I'm doing this video because I just put up a post -- I think last night -- on my blog which I will link in the sidebar, about we used two makeup removers. Now I'm not trying to be over news, because I suck at things like that, and that's much left to Irene; but this is my favorite makeup remover, and each of you know well makeup remover and as you can see I have not so much. 
, whirl win, um. I have not so much money right now, so I had to go looking for one and I found the great eye makeup in the world and I'm turning in all different directions because I'm trying to watch to see what I'm doing in the shadows. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to spill oil free makeup on my left side with Neutrogena One, and I'm going to do the equate on this eye, and I'm going to compare them. 
Right; cotton pad, equate.
Now make sure you get it in this bottle because the other bottle, the weird bottle, I don't know. If I can find a picture of it, I'll put it up.
Now, I'm not going to take all of it off; I'm -- we're going to do a test. I've got UDPP, a Cover Girl eye shadow Mac eye shadow; a Milani liner; a mixing medium brow pencil; I got all that. 
So what we're going to do is -- I can't do -- I hate this camera, I can't zoom with the camera so I have to like come like this. So, one swipe. I'm going to put it on and I'm going to hold it there for a couple of seconds. I'm just going to wipe. I don't even care if there's like residue. That is one swipe. 
Apparently, both my camera batteries are dead, and so I'm going to try to do this real fast, so that was one swipe with the equate one. So here is another cotton pad, Neutrogena, dumping it all over myself. Hold it for a few seconds. 
So, actually I can tell right now that it is no difference from the way they take the makeup off. Well, one swipe each, it's just as good as the equate, it's just as good as the Neutrogena in my opinion, and now I'm going to shut this camera off, go and charge the batteries, and take this stuff off. Bye.
