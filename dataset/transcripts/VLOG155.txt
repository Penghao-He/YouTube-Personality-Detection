Hi, YouTube. It's Wednesday, October 28, 2009 and I don't know about you but I grew up in the nineties and I was born and raised on Nickelodeon Slime Time Live, Spice Girls, NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, I grew up on all of that stuff. For me the nineties were filled with crazy awesome Halloween excursions with my brother. Uh, nothing too crazy mind you. It was just, you know, us three going around the neighborhood dressed up as, uh, Power Rangers -- I don't even know what we were dressed up as. Uh, I was always a bride or a princess or ballerina and they were always, like, a ninja or the Grim Reaper but we'd go around and we'd fill up our pillow cases with candy and we'd keep those bags of candy for months after Halloween. And I remember we'd have to clean them out of the refrigerator because they'd just gotten so gross and old and ugh. But just thinking about it has made me really nostalgic and it's made me miss my childhood because now that I'm in college -- you don't see many eighteen, nineteen, twenty year olds going trick or treating on Halloween. I mean you might but it's not really, uh, acceptable. I know I'm not going trick or treating this year. This will be my first year actually staying home and not really going out there. I just really like seeing people dressed up in costumes and thinking about how much work it took them to make it or how they thought to be a certain thing. I am always a big advocate for making costumes. I was an orange juice carton one year. I had a great time. Actually two years ago. This year I was an Undead Wendy and XXXX was Peter Pan so that was cool too. I was gonna be Pam from The Office but I decided not to be. I don't know. Um, not so -- in the comment below tell me your favorite Halloween moment or, uh, if you don't celebrate Halloween tell me your favorite type of candy because candy is kind of related to Halloween and I love candy. I'm actually, you know, I'm actually munching on some Hershey's with almonds. That's the only way I'll eat Hershey's is if it has almonds in it. Alright. Thanks for watching and I'll see you tomorrow.
