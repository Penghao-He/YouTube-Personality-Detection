Hey guys, it's XXXX. Um, yesterday we had an interview with, um, Amber something. I forgot it, but she plays as Sarah Fincher in the Skeleton Creek videos. I just want to say that she said hi to me because I asked. Yeah, it was, it was pretty cool. Like, if you missed it, like, don't worry. You can always see it in the next one. 
It actually, um -- well I found this website, well I didn't find it like some other person found it but I don't know if a lot of people, a lot of you people know about it. It's patrickcarmen dot com/skeletoncreek. Put that on the big toolbar thingy and it should, like, come up with this website. It has like all of the pictures and all of the videos like, that involve Skeleton Creek. Even the interview with the other guy, like, the director. They were gonna to put this, um, Amber one on there soon, so you should check that out if you missed it. And you can also download it and like, maybe put it on a website or something. 
And also Zack , aka Skeleton Creek's real is um, doing a contest, like to see who writes the best review on Skeleton Creek. So you just write a review and send it to his email. The email, I forgot it. It's on the website skeletoncreekfans dot com so you can check that out and try that out 'cause I am. 
So I guess that that's it. We'll see you guys later, bye.
