Okay guys. So, what I learned today about governments and civilicness -- uh -- yeah -- okay -- well it was a two minute Wikipedia search -- like -- and I've learned what fascism and socialism are, because I really didn't know. And this is what I've come up with, okay. Socialism is -- advocates an economic system where everybody does work and all the resources -- all the profit gained from that work, that everybody does, is available for everybody to draw resource from. So, let's say we're a socialist beet farm -- you know -- beet farming community, and we all farm beets. And so we make a big pile of all our beets and everybody gets a fair share of beets. I mean, that's -- that's what I got. 
Fascism -- and this is also fascism associated with Social Darwinism -- kind of -- is how I'm -- this is my perception of it. That fascism is when -- I forgot. It slips out of my brain so fast -- how does it happen? Um, fascism is when -- it's this whole -- I don't know. What I got is it's this thing where, you know, they think the weak are puny and the strong are the best. And everybody should be strong and strong versus weak, because the world is always in conflict, or something. And as a -- as a nation -- as a society we should be as strong as possible. Which, I also -- I -- I -- I think, you know, this might be like the darker side but Nazi Hitler side. 
Um, even though Hitler was a Nazi, not a fascist or -- is he a fascist? I don't fucking care about Hitler. So, um -- you know -- I was thinking that one race is the best. One group of people is the best. You know, they decide what the strongest is. So, that's different, okay. 
 I'll put some Wikipedia links on the side over there, under , you know -- but, uh, yeah -- so I'm gonna put some links to the Wikipedia pages 'cause I think if we all use Wikipedia we'll be super smart or at least on the same page. Like -- seriously, 'cause even if Wikipedia's wrong if everyone believed it it'd be right. For all intents and purposes it'd be right, so --
 Yee Yee Yee. I don't know, I feel like doing a dance. A dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance. Pepsi. Ah! Pepsi cola! 
Okay guys, go take care of the government now. Go fix things. Be citizens. Congratulations. I don't know. Go get a green card or something. I'll see you all later.
