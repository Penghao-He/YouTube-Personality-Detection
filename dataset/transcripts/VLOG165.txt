Hey friends. Um, it's been a while, about two weeks since I've made my last video and I just wanted to check in with you guys because I haven't made a video in a while of me just talking. Um, most of them have been songs, but I would like to announce that this week I'm going into finals. Um, well it's the week before finals and then finals, um, so I have no time to be on the interwebs. 
I've a final project and a final portfolio due for one class and that's pretty much it, um, and then finals, but I'm really bogged down with stuff this week, so I just wanted to say hi. 
Along with that I just wanted to see, um, if you guys would do something for me because I haven't blogged any in a while, um, and I thought I'd welcome myself to summer being back from crew, um, with a questions video. I've never done a questions video before and, um, I want you guys to leave me questions, ah, so I can answer them for you. Um, put them in the comments below and then I'll have one fun big summer question video when I'll probably film outside and be like, it's summer, wooh! 
Um, the XXXX, which is gonna be me, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and unknown person; we don't know yet. Well, I have an idea, but I'll announce it later. Um, that will be starting up soon on a channel by itself, um, once I figure all that stuff out 'cause apparently I'm, like, spearheading the project. Ah, I will tell you about it and -- so you all can enjoy that loveliness. 
There was a hit in that last clip. As to who the person might be, if you figure it out, cool. If you don't, doesn't matter because I'm going to tell you who it is anyway later, not now. 
Um, anyway, um, leave questions below. If you've never seen a questions video they've been all over the YouTubes. I will link in a -- the sidebar one of XXXX's Question Tuesday videos, which is kind of what I want to do, I guess, sort of, but leave those questions and it'll have fun times. Yay!
