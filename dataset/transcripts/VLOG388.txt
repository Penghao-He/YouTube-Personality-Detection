Not turned on. Not turned on. 
Hi guys, it's been a while since I made a video and I want to make a video with a general update and to . I went to last week. It was awesome. Uh, it was an epic concert. They really put on the show. It was really amazing. 
On December fifth we had a celebration uh, Sin -- Sinta Claus it's called. Similar to San -- Santa Claus but we also do uh, do presents under the christmas tree, but we don't uh, the children here don't believe in Santa Claus, they believe in Sinta Claus. 
I got some cool presents. I will show you in the DVD update I'm gonna do. Um, it was awesome. So I didn't come to do no more videos so, because -- and in the situation, and that is, um, I told you I got a job. I love my job. And, yeah. 
If people tell you a story why they lose their job and what's the story, the -- it's not their fault. You're always thinking, yeah. But what is the story of the other -- of the other side from the people who fired them? What's the real reason? Someone -- someone who is fired always tells they're not at fault. They're, uh, or they don't tell the whole story, yeah? But I am certainly one of the guys who, yeah. Definitely gonna tell the story straight. How -- how -- how it went. 
Um. Media, uh, minimarts. I work at Stern . Uh, I explained that in the other video, and they're the same as the MediaMarket and the MediaMarket is more known as they're all around the world, so some people may know -- may know it, some people not. 
This is like -- it's like a big -- a big entertainment store and they sell TVs, CDs, DVDs, video games, uh, washing machines, you call it. And Saturn is the same as that, basically the same company only they're smaller. 
And they hired me two months ago uh, for uh, uh, for -- to do sales only on the CD/DVD video games and most times when you try to sell something it's on the section from the DVD game -- uh, the video games. Wednesday, they invited me to have a talk because uh, my period -- yeah, my period -- this sounds very wrong -- uh, my -- my trial period at their store almost expended and I went -- I went uh, yeah, to be exactly yesterday but I went to Brussels uh, this weekend um, for the Christmas . 
But so they invited me for a talk and they said uh, yeah, after this period uh, we have to do a lot of -- yeah. Uh, they have to send back a lot of CDs, DVDs. They have to get -- things out of the shop, uh, because of the store and send them back to the uh, to the distribution company or someone else. All of this administration work, and they -- they said I wouldn't -- uh, yeah, um -- I wouldn't yeah do that, or we'll not -- could not handle that or something like that. 
At the time yeah, I should have been sharper and said, why you think that, why do you think I can't handle that? But I was so overwhelmed by more like, what the hell's happening? Um, and that was just a bullshit reason because um, they could check how much -- I was -- I sold a lot. I was every day, almost every day, I was a top uh, top salesman from all the stuff in the store. I was number three or number two, once num -- number one. Because I did -- I -- I -- I did -- I sold very well. I did -- I was a very good salesman on the floor. So it wasn't a reason, yeah, to get me fired but then, uh, yeah, I was really -- someone who first -- or last of all think what the hell's happening, and afterwards I really can get pissed. I'd use a line the one like this, I'm really wishing the worst of people who are responsible for getting me -- get -- getting me fired. 
I think why -- why would you do something -- why let someone quit his uh, part time job and then in the same -- at the station -- uh, oh fu -- how do you say that -- that was a period -- trial period over, it's moved over and you get a contract for half a year. That's really pissed me off. I really feel like slapping or punching someone in the face. I don't -- I don't -- I -- I do now that it doesn't help but it feels good to -- to make them -- yeah, feel what I feel. 
Okay this sounded like -- like -- a little bit sorry, it's just uh, rage and it's more talk than yeah, I'd actually -- something, do really something but I'm not going to, I just feel better. It was a temporary job. 
How I hope I've hooked this contract for six months and find something else that fits my education uh, because I don't do -- I didn't -- yeah, I did -- I started with a low education in middle school and worked to, uh, yeah, do college for -- study for -- for construction with that there's a middle NBO called external for that kind of qualification and then do a high -- uh, higher education. That's just a step below university, it's called HBO by the way, that's uh, very funny, but um, when you finish you don't -- that you find a job that fits your study and, yeah, pays more than what I do now. This job what I did -- pay money and I had something to do -- this job didn't pay much but I learned how to sell something, how to communicate with people. I can barely -- I was really friendly to customers, I really could help them, get on their level and so it did help them with the good sales. This they disrespect me so much there. Um. 
Also the reason I think -- I realize now, first that it was -- it made any sense. They had training to sell, to train you -- to train your sale -- to train you into make better sales and they told me first uh, day they forgot to plan me uh, in for the courses, for the training and now it makes sense because if you hire someone who you uh, who you -- who you kick away after a struggle why put him on courses? It's only a waste of money. 
So that's probably the reason why I -- they forgot to -- to -- to put me on the training. So yeah, so I know help, you have to be the better one and eh. This -- this is not my work but I -- I didn't do this but this is my brother's work. I ripped out the buttons and that is a small work shirt and my brother made it -- knots in it and it's very -- really tight and I have to deliver them back. 
When you've worked there up to two months you get twenty percent off the price, uh, so I asked, I wanted to get screened there and it wasn't -- they didn't -- the delivery have to come in and then first going to get but that with twenty percent off the price, and then I come to deliver the keys back. That's all, yeah. I had the paper, they had to sign the paper and you contract a day when you don't give them back or something like that you have to pay fifty Euro or so, but I am not going to. She saw I had first gone to buy the screen and then I going to deliver these forms back. 
it's really childish, but I had to put on my rates on something and I -- my rent. So yeah, I don't got a job now, I don't want to go back to my job where I worked and do that full time, I thought I hate it when it's part time, but this is the only place where I got certainty to go back to for now and but I don't want to. It's five days in a week and it with -- I really hate it and I don't want to go there. 
So. Okay. Had a -- um, also I want to say on twenty six November -- on November of twenty six, um, I went, um, I was a year on YouTube with this channel. Um, got um, almost three years on YouTube with my other Channel, but I wanted to a video that day but then I had to work and I didn't have many time so um, my year on YouTube -- I really love it and met a lot of nice people with cool channels. Uh, it was really cool, a very, very cool community and I am very happy here. I hope I reach the four hundred subscribers before I, uh -- I hit the full year, so its nice number, but yeah, sounds about the subscribers, but -- but it will be fun though. 
Um, so yeah, I really -- really um, I want to thank --
