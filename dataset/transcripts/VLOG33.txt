Hi Youtube. We're back. It is Friday, September the fourth, which means this weekend is Labor Day Weekend and XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX will be here, so -- they're actually already in town, but they're just getting ready and stuff, so we're waiting for them. 
Decided we should make a video just to let you guys know what's up. Chloe had her six month shot on, I think it's Wednesday, so two days ago and she did really well. She didn't even cry this time, so I'm really proud of her. What else? Seventeen pounds fifteen ounces, she's a big girl. And um, what else? She has a little bit of a cold right now, just a runny nose, but other than that, she's doing great and she just crawled this morning. Not very far, just to get a toy, but she crawled, so that's the important thing, right Chloe? 
Um, say hi everyone, say hi. What are you doing? She's kinda busy tearing everything apart at the moment, throwing all my stuff off the desk, so I guess I should be going. 
Um, me and XXXX will probably have a video for everyone up soon of our kids together, Chris and Chloe, and until then, have a good Labor Day Weekend and I hope everyone's having fun or camping or doing whatever. So have a good weekend and I'll see you soon. Bye.
