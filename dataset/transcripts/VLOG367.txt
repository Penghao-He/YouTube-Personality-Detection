Hey guys. I could have been either one of those things for Halloween, but, um, Halloween's not really, like, a -- a really big thing in Belgium, so we didn't really celebrate it. Um, we had sort of a Halloween movie night and we wanted to watch horror movies. 
Ah, so Reese's girlfriend Vanessa; she came over and we watched, ah, Let the Right One In. And, we had this Halloween horror night but it was kind of a fail, 'cause well the movie is -- it's a really pretty movie. It's a Swedish movie but it wasn't, like, horrorish and I fell asleep. But yeah, we had a cool Halloween night. 
Um, so this is sort of a response to a Tyler Oakley, uh, clip, ah, that I saw, which I really loved. Ah, he asked for pictures or clips, uh, of your Halloween costumes. I don't really have, like, you know, those slutty costumes; I don't have those. But I have cool masks, right? Okay, so these could have been my Halloween costumes, but then, you know, nothing happened. 
Oh, also Tyler Oakley, um, in his clip; he talked about overalls and how he wanted to, like, be able to like wear them in public. He wanted them to become acceptable again and I totally support that. Because, I have two pairs of overalls and I never get to wear them, because I'm afraid people will laugh at me. But, I think they're really cool. Aren't they? 
Ain't nobody around. I'm just sittin' here by myself with next to nothing on my mind. Yeah. Ain't nobody around. I'm just sittin' here by myself with --
Anyway, um, that's the clip for today; overalls and Halloween. You know, it should -- should be good, right? So, I hope you like the clip. I hope you had a great weekend and I see y'all soon. Peace out. I just said y'all; does that make me, like, a bit of, like, hillbilly, like. Bye y'all. 
Ain't nobody around.
