Good morning everybody, it's Sunday morning and my days on me. 
That's what that is. 
Good afternoon. 
We are driving to Paris, or actually it Lecher near Paris, eh, you guys know we're going to I XXXX Juvelance Christmas Jam, which is a specific beat, a specific type of BMX freestyle. It's, um, it's a rider, a small freestyle BMX bike, and the flat surface is like break dancing on a small bike, you'll see. 
It's just a bike. 
I thought you said there's a bike in the back. 
That's my camera bag and all the stuff. This is food and drinks, very important, and eh, this is my buddy's car, he's driving of course. This is his -- is his car. 
And we've got two hours and twenty five minutes to go before we reach our destination, and this is France, we just crossed the border into France eh, that means we've been through Belgium and um, we've been driving now for about -- how long we've been driving? 
Almost two hours. 
Almost two hours so, eh, the weather is great we got some sun and it's dry and, so that makes good weather conditions for driving, yup. 
So I was just saying to my face that all though it's two hours away France is extremely different from the Netherlands, so is Belgium by the way, and it's very close to where we live. 
I think the whole culture and the way the people live, and listening to the navigation system and talking get to the wrong lane or something so, uh, yes completely different to the Netherlands, um, especially the buildings and the way the infrastructure is, but you know also the people itself . Could I live in France? I don't know, I could live everywhere, I just, you know, adapt to my surroundings, but, I think I like the Netherlands better. 
How about you XXXX, could you live in France? 
Je ne sais pas. 
That's French for I don't know. I will teach you guys French words. So, hello is -- um, it's -- can bebon jour, which is hello. But I know, I learned that only tourists say that. But French people, when they greet each other they say salut. So yeah, salut. 
Croissant. 
Croissant. You know croissant, guys? Yeah, you know croissant. Anyway, parapluie, he he. 
Anyway, we'll see we're driving on the highway, uh, maximum speed on the highway is the same as the Netherlands, I think, a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour. 
Did I tell you I like this car. XXXX is alo -- already over there. And it was kinda disappointing that they didn't ride so much it was more like, um, you know, just doing, having some fun together and teaching or showing the little kids that, you know, are in XXXX Juevelance's Flatlands corps. You know, what Flatland is and, you know it was in a jam like a regular jam where they do like pretty hard tricks and links and stuff. So, it was too bad. It was good to see XXXX and XXXX again and all the French riders, and good, you know, to get back into the scene like this, like a contest on a small scale. So I'm going to go home now, it's five o'clock. Hopefully we will be home at around eleven o'clock. 
Maybe, we'll see. Where's our car? 
So, we are driving home and now its five o'clock and this computer says it will take four hours and fifteen minutes to get home so that'll actually means we'll get home, uh, early, early, early. So uh, um, yeah, we're rid -- we're driving to Lecher, this small town where the jam was and, you know, kinda disappointed that you know that, you know, it wasn't any hard core riding being done, but you know, it was good to see XXXX and XXXX and you know. So they know, you know, I'm back in business. 
And our little XXXX was wearing his hat and we're going home and stop -- you know stop somewhere to get a bite to eat. Right, XXXX? 
At the Mac. 
The McDonald's, of course. Yeah, we're having fun. Yup, we're going to get some dinner over here at the restaurant. Hopefully, it will be good and edible, which is not always the case here in France. So we're waiting in line here, it's not like , but you know it's food. So we were looking at the food over there and we were thinking like, that's like, that's like really gross, so not going to do that. 
Probably get a sandwich or something hopefully, maybe, we'll see a McDonald's on the way cause it's unbelievable we've been driving for almost like two hours or something an hour in a half, no McDonald's. 
No, one McDonald's. 
Yeah, one McDonald's, you know, we saw that one when we were like passed -- when we passed it, so pretty stupid. So, um, yeah we'll probably get a sandwich or something cause the food over there is really gross. And finally we found a McDonald's. Yeah. 
As you can see guys, I'm back home again that's right, and it was a long day and a timing day especially for XXXX who did all the driving four and hal -- four and a half hours to go there, four and a half hours to come back. I know you guys in US and Canada are used to driving long stretches like this, but for us in Europe it's a really long drive. Anyway, we had a lot of fun, eh, um, I had a lot of fun, XXXX had a lot of fun um, yeah, it just a cool thing to go on a road trip again. Me and XXXX we used to go like contest together, um you know. We would hang out for a weekend somewhere, someplace, some city and, you know, dinner and fun and stuff like that so that I'm glad that we, uh, did it again. And hopefully, we'll do it more often. We're planning to do it more often so that's really cool. Um, you want to see any Flatland riding in this video guys, um, that's the way I'll -- I'll -- I'm going to do it with all the, uh you know, places I go to regarding BMX Flatland. Um, you'll see a small impression of the Flatlands riding being done if you click on this link. It'll go to my other channel, my special projects channel. And this channel will be just for, you know, the video di -- video diary, the road trip in itself, traveling, you know, me, flogging. So, uh, when it comes to like filming material for XXXX in my video magazine it was a, uh, a bad day, it was a huge disappointment actually, um, because there wasn't any real hard core or flatland riding being done. It was just more about XXXX , um you know, he has this place to himself, it's like his trading spot, and like he's giving back to the -- his community by he has flatland school where he teaches young kids, so it was more about riders getting together, you know, for the kids, you know, doing some small, you know, stuff for the kids, some, some riding, some relaxed riding for the kids there. So, it wasn't really like hard core riding that I want for my flatland video magazine. So, in ca -- in terms of, uh, filming material for XXXX was a bad day but in, um, when talking about, um, the first event for me to go on re launch XXXX, to get back into the flatland scene again, is -- it was a good day. Um, I had the opportunity to talk to XXXX and XXXX in a relaxed atmosphere, um, we talked about XXXX and flatland in general and where it's going and you know. So yeah, everybody's enthu -- enthusiastic about XXXX getting back in flatland TV so that's good. But anyway, I'm going to leave you guys with a Reinato quiz question for today which is. My friend XXXX is not from the city Helmond, where I come from, where I live in, so what city is XXXX from? Okay, so if you don't know the answer to that question you should check out Thursday's video which is called an Alien Spaceship has Landed and you'll find the answer in there. I'm going to go to bed now and I'll see you guystomo.
