Ay caramba, yow , ditiling , that one, no, um, so I don't usually do this. I'm not much of a blogger. I don't blog at all, but I want to talk about this because, uh, I can do whatever I want with the camera. Seriously, ah, Marge Simpson from the Simpsons TV show, twenty years on the air, last night shouldn't count, um, is going to be on the cover of Playboy magazine and she's going to be nude or quote very, very racy inside the magazine. This blows my mind for several reasons. First of all, have we slipped into some sort of parallel dimension called Japan where cartoon pornography reigns supreme? Or just what's going on over Playboy? Like they really -- they ran out of human girls? Like, we're not -- when I crack open a Playboy magazine which doesn't happen often, 'cause now I have the internet. 
 Um, I don't -- I don't usually want to see cartoons naked, I -- I don't know. Maybe -- maybe I'm weird. Maybe -- maybe I'm old fashioned but I like a nice set of human jugs and a nice human butt. Uh, yellow skin freaks me out. That's not a knock on agent. Um, but I -- first of all, if we're going by popular female cartoon characters right now, I'd think Lowen -- Lois -- Lowen -- I think Lois Griffin's more appealing, I don't know. Maybe I have a thing for red heads. Maybe I want to see Alex Borstein naked, although she's kind of round. But that's another story. 
 Look the bottom line is -- is, several other cartoon, uh, female cartoon characters, I'd rather see nude. Number one on that list is Cheetara from Thunder Cats. Although, I'm pretty sure I can imagine what that would look like and that sort of an animal thing and the getting the beastiality -- all right so no on Cheetara. Um, what about Teela from the He man series? Huh? Little -- Little kids out there? All my -- da, viewers under the age of thirty? He man? Teela? No? Anybody? How about Jane Jetson? How about that, Jane Jetson the little Flintstones in penthouse doing some sort of lesbo thing? Although I hear -- I hear they both aged horribly, lot of wrinkles and sagging so we'll scrap that idea. 
But the bottom line is, I know Hugh hefner's old. I know he's getting to the point where he's -- how do you say, bat shit crazy. I know that he has his life filmed; that he make believes that he's sleeping with twins now and all that jazz but at what point is he like, you know what else, like let's have a naked cow on Playboy? Let's -- let's die her up nice and let's put her right in there - give her a pictorial. Who doesn't love milk right? Am I right guys? It's the twentieth anniversary of milk, they're like, oh, oh, he's lost his shit. No, nobody knows what's wrong. 
So I -- I -- I want -- I want your opinion on this. Ah, first of all do you want me to do any bloggy stuff like this anymore? Probably not? Um, are -- secondly are you going to buy it? I mean is the internet kind of killed Playboy out of the whole, like -- like the uniqueness of it, like when a celebrity does Playboy? It's like who gives a shit, let's go on the internet the next day and find the photos that somebody's scanned in. I'm like whatever. I'm like -- are you guys , girls? 
Do you want to start seeing male cartoon characters, uh, nude anywhere? I don't know is cartoon porn like a big thing? Am I -- am I missing out on this? Like, dude you're not watching cartoon porn? Ooh, how gay are you on a scale of one to queer? I'm like I don't know, you tell me. Um, so yeah, video, respond, comment, let me know your thoughts on this. I really want to get a collective opinion of how behind the times I am or how, you know, right I am that this is kind of creepy and weird and no one's really going to buy it and it's not that special. Let me know. .
