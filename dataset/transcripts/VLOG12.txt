So, um, ehh, I don't know -- I don't know what else I can say. I'm just too fast you little fuckers. And when the thoughts goes -- goes too well; just letting the thoughts come rolling. 
I saw Nine Inch Nails live, my favorite band. I saw, you know, I saw Nine Inch Nails, my favorite band, live, back in November. November the fifth, to be exact. Uh, right after the election. That was fucking amazing concert. 
Um, I think I'm going to call this video the most random shit ever, just the most ra -- I know, I okay -- I know, shh, quiet. I know a lot of my vids are already pretty random but, seriously, what to talk about? So many things in the world to talk about, so many things. 
Well, fuck politics. I don't know shit about that, or economics, or any of that stuff. I mean, I -- I can say I know a little bit about what's going on, but I'm not gonna get into it. That was never my intention, to start up some blog -- start up some blog where I just chat about, you know, things that I don't know shit about. So -- uh, in other words, I don't know enough to talk about them, or encourage it. You get the idea. 
I'm not even looking at the camera when I talk, I'm kinda looking off into space. I gotta stop that, I'm not even looking at the camera. Need to just stare at the camera, give it a sexy stare. Just kinda -- you hearing that sound, that little chukka chukka, chukka, chukka? Can you hear it? Chukka chukka, chukka, chukka. Those are my legs; they're shaking to and fro. But they're not shaking out of perverted purposes, perverts. Or pedophiles, you know who you are. 
Made a pretty pointless vid here. I mean this is very, very terrible -- this is a very terrible video and I'm very sorry. Just keep talking and talking and talking. I'm gonna have a fucking terrible time editing this shit out, when I wake up or whenever I do this. 
Um, oh yeah, I'm going to go at -- well, I could go -- I could just write it down, but I guess I'll just say it, before I forget about it. I think I orig -- I originally started the video camera, started the webcam with the idea of getting this thought down. That way I could remember it and go back over it. Just uh, some of you may consider this terrible or whatever but some of you may consider it making fun of our -- of our -- of our troops, you know of -- of the -- of the American troops, not going to say our troops. 
Don't give me that, don't you give me that. I don't own these guys. No, I don't, I don't. And I'm not into this for -- but I'm not getting into politics, okay? I'm staying away from it tonight. Um, yeah, I realize they're humans and all that -- but okay, anyway -- anyway. Okay, so anyway, like I was saying, you know, God bless the strong and brave men and women, your stand around hunter while he's high. God bless our troops, standing around them. 
I just kinda thought, you know, I was kinda thinking to myself about that, like, seems like whenever I'm a little out of it, or, you know, due to probably some substance or whatever. Well, I guess I'm never really safe to be around. In a certain sense, it's not, like, I'm just going to bust you up all a sudden but, you know, you're obviously not going to have the best dreams after hanging around me for a bit. 
Anyway, so I'm talking about, you know, like, if I'm a little out of it due to a certain substance or whatever. Um, anyone -- anyone who is around me, you know, who is actually brave enough to stay around me, um, for fear of my, you know, just going too far, um, I gotta give you credit. Gotta give you lots of credit and pats on the backs. Lots of pats on the backs, lots and lots of pats on the backs. 
I'm getting to that point where I'm not really -- I -- I'm actually pretty tired, but, oh man, I could go to sleep, but I kinda think I wanna stay up for a bit. I'm actually waiting for a gift by um, by Trent Reznor or by Nine Inch Nails. They have it up on their site and Iam. com. They have this thing up there since the seventeenth I think it is, um saying, you know, we may have a new video -- we may -- whoa -- you know, we may have a -- we may have a little hol -- we may have a little holiday gift for you soon, check back. 
So you have the word may, you have the word soon, where you have those words, and it's just -- those words are so uncertain. Last time they said soon, it took what, two weeks, you know? Two weeks for something to pop up on the site. 
Um, and then may, it's like a, well, that's -- I mean, Trent is very committed to his fans and Iam is very committed to the Nine Inch Nails community, of course. Um, but you know, when you say the word may, it's kinda like, well I may edit this video tomorrow. 
But then again, if I'm saying I may, wait hold on . Bless me, thank you, thank you so much. Such a great, great person. 
But yeah, it's like I'm saying I may edit this video tomorrow. Um, you know, I -- I uh, I may not edit this video tomorrow. May is -- is half and half. That's like saying, well, you know, might do it might not. Either or. Um, but then we got 'em to say may do it soon. That's kinda like well I might do it in the near future or I might not, you know? Might take a long time, it might never be there, it might actually be there pretty soon, and considering it's a holiday gift, you know, I'm thinking okay, let's see what time it is. 
Well it's about two forty five here, which is fifteen minutes of course 'til -- that is a quarter 'til three, um, which means that it would be midnight over in California, by that point, and that's where Nine Inch Nails is basically located right now, in California, which means their New Year's would strike and the New Year would strike and um, they would -- um, that would be the other -- that would be another opportunity for the whole holiday idea, 'cause Christmas already came and went; there was no gift, you know? But, now this is New Years, so maybe a different situation. So I'm kinda excited about that; I might stay up for a bit. 
Long tangent there, very long, I know, but well, I love expressing myself.
