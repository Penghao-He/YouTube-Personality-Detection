Well, hello everyone and welcome to the XXXX. It's December twenty ninth two thousand and six. A couple of days left in this year and we'll be in a whole new year. I certainly hope that, uh, two thousand and seven is a great year for everybody watching and I hope that our country and the world has a much better year than we've had this past year. Well I want to start right off today by talking about some of the things that are in the news. In fact that's today's shows about, it's a news day. Um, and a hot topic has got to be everywhere in this country, at least tech wise has got to be Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs is in the news today and, uh, he is being investigated by the Securities Exchange Commission for possibly accepting some, uh, some stocks under a um -- I'm not exactly sure what's going on -- I don't want to make some comments that are inaccurate, but he is being investigated in that manner. 
Now I saw on the Today Show that most people buying Apple related equipment would still do so whether Steve Jobs was indicted for problems or not and I, uh, I would understand that assumption. But nonetheless, um, the fact that a high profile businessman like Jobs might be involved in some irregular stock purchasing, if you will, reminds you of somebody else don't it, a chef of some kind? Yes, that happened with her too, uh, Miss Stewart if I recall. I guess all that money just gets-- everybody gets itchy when they see that potential and they can't keep their hands off. 
I was once told that there is group of people that, uh, that cannot keep their hands off money when it's there to be had. Um, gosh isn't that something, Steve Jobs. 
Anyhow, let's move right along because we don't want to go too long on this um on any of these subjects. 
As everyone knows Gerald Ford recently passed away; the former President of the United States filled in for Richard Nixon. Was not reelected but was nonetheless a very popular man. And, uh, gave a interview to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Everyone knows Bob Woodward and of course, um, he gained his fame from the Nixon tapes and Bob Woodward just loves to jump on things whenever he's got the opportunity. And, um, Ford gave him this interview on his views of, uh, whether or not the Iraq War should have started and of course under the agreement that the interview would not be published until Ford's death. Well boy oh boy, what do you think, the day Ford is dead, Woodward is out there telling everybody, telling the world. And, um, the man's not even in the ground yet and the word is spread around the world that Gerald Ford, a very popular President of the United States, a former President, uh, was against the war in Iraq. Old Bob Woodward just cannot wait to get his hands on the money if you will. I saw he was on the Today Show being interviewed and that's what the man wanted and he is getting it right now. 
Another thing in the news right now and everybody knows about it by the time they see this on the web. Saddam Hussein might be gone. He might be gone from this earth. He was scheduled to hang, and, uh, potentially be hanged by the end of this weekend if -- if not the beginning of this weekend. And, um, he is a former Dictator of Iraq and he is being charged and convicted of killing over a hundred and some innocent men and boys. And he should be put to death and, uh, and very quick. I've always been of the opinion, when he was found in the hole in the ground that he was hiding, that chicken shit. Uh, somebody should've put a bullet right then and there, just in case he somehow eluded capture or eluded, uh, justice. Who knows what could happen but anyhow he is scheduled to die and that's a good thing. 
So after that who knows what's going to happen in Iraq. I certainly hope for the best for, uh, all the countries involved. For our country, all the men and women that are over there and, um, and, uh, everybody involved. Okay, that's the Sophie Show for today. I hope everybody had a good time and um, I'll be putting together another one real soon. I'm playing it by ear, as something comes along I put it up. I put things up that, um, that I find that I think are worth looking at and, um, I put things up that I make. So it's a variety show and I hope you enjoy it and keep coming back and looking for more. Bye for now.
