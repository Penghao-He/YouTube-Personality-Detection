Hey, YouTube. I'd just like to tell you two things that bother me. One, is -- well, I'll just give you a little introduction. One day at sailing, the -- somehow the subject of gays came up and bis and straights. And this one little said, "I know somebody who's gay. " And she said it, like, it was, like, amazing. And it was, like, she just like broke a world record. And, I'm like -- and I said, "Oh, aren't you special. " Because, I know many people who are gay. Well, look, I know many people who are gay, and they have to cope through so many things. And what I hate, absolutely hate, is how people say, "Oh, that's so gay. " Or because they don't like the fact that someone's gay, so they're like, "Oh, that's so gay, " instead of "Oh, that's so shitty. Oh, that's so crappy. Oh, that's garbage. Oh, I hate that. " Say that. Because you have no idea what these people have to go through every single day. Okay? I hope it's cool, with you guys. 
Number two. Yeah, I don't hate this as much, because this is their self hate. They -- they have to choose this. They have to choose. I can't tell them, 'cause I'm not sure what I actually understand what it is . I can't understand what these people are going through because if they want to cut themselves, then they have to be going -- I can't -- they -- they have to be going through something way harder than I knew. So I just, like, live life every day, and I'm all like, "Woo. Party. " But I can't understand what the thing that's going through these people's minds, because they truly are troubled and I can't help them. Well, I can, but. . . You? And me? We can help them. So, people who, like, cut themselves and self injure themselves; I don't really know what to say, 'cause I know many people who do that. Who cut. And they're all, like, some of them are really close friends. Some of them aren't. But, like, I know them, and if you know someone, then -- anyway, it's like they're in here. Somewhere you just know them. So don't just, like, blow them off, and let go of stereotops [sic. ] -- types -- and be like, "Oh, they're so anal. Oh, they cut themselves. " No. They can't bear with life, they can't cope with life. And it is pretty hard, if you ask me; and you should know. And you should -- you should know. Like, there's -- there's -- there's many of you out there, right now, on the earth, who can't deal with it. So they feel that to escape from it, they have to injure themselves. So, it's like relief. I don't know if you know what I mean. It feels good. . But it just like, to know that I know someone out there right now, or there is someone out there right now, that can't cope with life, that can't bear his life, and they feel that they just wanna die, and they -- their escape plan is to die. It not only hurts them, but they're affecting everybody around the world, because one person's pain is another person's pain. And so on it travels and echoes throughout the whole world. And I just thought I'd like to make that point out to all of you who -- Okay, so. Peace out YouTube. Oh, comment. Comment. And subscribe. That'd be cool. So, peace. I'll be seeing you guys later.
