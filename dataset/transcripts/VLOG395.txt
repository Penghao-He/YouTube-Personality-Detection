Hey, everyone. I haven't made a blog in a while so I just thought I would update you all on a few things. What was the last thing we talked about? It's been a couple weeks -- it's been a few weeks since I made a blog. But, um. Here's what's going on at my job. As many of you know, I got taken off of my route job and I got put into the shop. I'm kinda back out on the route now but I'm training a new guy. And here's why. I trained a guy before. He was out on the route. He was doing a good job. He started slacking off. He started getting an attitude. He smarted off to the boss. He started looking kinda sloppy, not shaving, not tucking his shirt in, not wearing a belt. Told the boss that they didn't pay him enough for him to shave and tuck his shirt in, which is kinda bullshit. And after that he just -- it just seemed like he stopped caring then he went off on me in front of the boss. They fired his ass. So now I'm training a new guy. Also, this guy that they fired, he told the boss that I threatened to kill him which is bullshit, because I didn't. I've been training this new guy since Friday -- last Friday. And uh, he's doing pretty good. I'll probably be out with him for a few weeks and then I getting my job back in the shop. And I'm -- this is moving up and down 'cause I got my laptop on my lap, or will. You just have to bounce with me. 
My wife and I ordered a new Christmas present for the both of us. Uh, we've never had a Nintendo Wii so there was a special, uh, -- what's it called -- that Cyber Monday sale thing? And we ordered a Nintendo Wii with all kinds of extra stuff. And we should be getting it soon. Ordered a few games. Got our Christmas shopping done with -- well, almost. 
And there was something else I wanted to talk about. but I forgot what it was. It was cold and rainy outside today. Huh. Uh, my back hurts. What's new? Uh, my laptop -- it kinda took a shit on itself -- my old laptop. Ah -- my wife tried to take it to the IT tech at her work and have him look at it and he couldn't fix it. She brought it back home and I fixed it. So I gave it to her. So she got a perfectly fine laptop for free. 
 Uh, YouTube rap music video, I've got the track -- I got all that done. The music's done. Now I've gotta put the video together. I've started putting bits and pieces together, but I still gotta record my part. But, uh, I still want you all's clips. If you all wanna send me any clip. A lot of you all might've taken that video the wrong way where I said send me any clips. I've had a couple people say can I send you anything, can I -- can I send you some music? No, it's a music video. It's my music, my lyrics, my song. I'm singing it and I just want clips of you, like, random clips of you blogging. To talking to the camera, doing driving blogs, uh. Anything from your previous videos which is simply short, like, looking at the camera, crossing your eyes or sticking your tongue out. Just anywhere from, like, two to five seconds long. 'Cause I'm gonna have random clips, like, shoot across the screen or something like that, whatever. But, um. So something simple like that. And if you're lucky I might throw on another preview on the -- at the end of this video. Like, just a little short clip of the song, the finished song -- if you're lucky. Now we're just gonna be cheesy. 
Uh -- you know -- I can't think of anything else to talk about right now. What I was gonna talk about -- there was something else I wanted to talk about, but I can't remember and I'll probably remember as soon I finish editing this video and get it ready to upload. I'll probably remember then. 
If I do I'll just write it over in the description -- sample or I'll make another video tomorrow. But, uh, yeah -- that's it for now. I'm gonna try to start blogging a little more. But I just haven't -- haven't really felt like it lately. I haven't -- I just haven't had -- just haven't felt like blogging. I haven't really had much to talk about. But, uh, I guess that is it for now and I'll talk to you all later. 
 This video goes out to all my payers. Immature small penis wanna be dictators. If you don't like my cheesy ass rap song you can just go suck a dick all day long. Just think of YouTube; it's been so much fun. If I've never found the internet, what would I've done? What I've done if I've never found the internet -- I'd probably be sitting here staring at the TV set. I would've never been or called a newb. I would've never found this community on YouTube. What I've done if I've never found the internet -- I'd probably sitting here staring at the TV set.
