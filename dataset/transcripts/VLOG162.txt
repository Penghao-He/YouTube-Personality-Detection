Hey, YouTube . It's ten o'clock PM right now. I should be doing my homework, but I decided to make a video because -- wait, I have a shirt off again because I'm, well -- I'm going to bed. 
I just got out of the shower, so. I usually just don't put on any clothes. I don't know. Well, I have clothes on. I have boxers on. Whatever. 
Anyway. I wanted to, uh, tell you guys something. Um, I been, as -- as you guys know, I've been hanging out with this girl I like for the past two weeks. I -- I thought it was going really good, like, really, really good. And I thought maybe she liked me a little bit. 
And then today I asked her out. Like, I just straight up -- I walked up; I was, like, hey, do you want to be my girlfriend? Honest -- it was full of crap. She said, Honestly, I like you as a friend. And then she was, like, maybe in the future, but right now I just like you as a friend. And I was, like, okay, that's fine. And then she's, like, I'm sorry. It's like, it's fine, but, totally, just right there, just --
That's sucks. 
But I don't -- I don't really think there's any hope for us dating in the future. She said it. It might be true, but I don't -- I don't believe it. I've been told that at -- by another girl, but it never really happened, so. 
All right. I'm giving up today. Didn't sell anymore, just gave the people their pre orders, but I'll make a review soon. 
Peace, guys.
