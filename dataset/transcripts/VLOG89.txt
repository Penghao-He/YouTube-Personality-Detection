Hello, everyone. It is Wednesday, December second and this is your five video. Hope all of you had a really good Thanksgiving. Um, I didn't see any recent videos, so I'm assuming it was good. 
But I know mine was awesome. I'm sorry I didn't post last week. It's just, Wednesday was my travel day and I was pretty much gone from eight in the morning until I landed at Minneapolis at seven at night. So, I mean it was a long day of planes and trains, automobiles, but other than that, my break was great. 
I got to see all of my friends and hung out with my family and um, I saved one hundred and twenty dollars on the first four seasons of House, so I mean, Black Friday well spent in my opinion. But uh, it went really fast and -- although it was really good to be home, it was definitely kind of just like oh, it was like, you know, like the carrot dangling in front of me. But I'll be back in less than three weeks anyway. I think I fly home on the nineteenth or whatever, so now it's kind of just the final push through finals, half final push uh, but um, yeah I don't know. It's going to be good. 
I have, let's see, well I have a paper for my two level class and I have a paper for my Brit Lit class and I have a Latin final final, but that should be fine and then I have a portfolio to finish for my writing class. And so, it's just going to be a lot of writing and I like that, but at the same time I'm kinda just like, aww, we have Beatles rock band in the house now, and that's what I'd rather be doing. Actually, we're doing that tonight, we're having a Beatles rock band party. So, you know I'm being productive. 
But, I don't know, it's just it's my favorite time of year and I'm in an ugly sweater today in honor of December second and its chilliness and the fact that it's December and I really want a candy cane. Um, yeah, but I -- I don't know. 
I just am like, like, basically the last three months of the year are when I'm in my element, like I just love them and it's the best. So I'm really excited and I'm excited to be home and I'm excited to go to England, and just, I'm really excited. 
I don't think I told you guys, but a few weeks ago Hank Green came to Seattle and I flipped out and was so excited to go, until I realized that his, like CD signing thing was the same night as my roommate's musical theater performance, which I had promised months before to go to. So, once again, I did not get to meet the Greens. 
My friend Ari was nice enough to get a CD signed for me, so now I have a little Hank Green CD with an Anglofish on it and my name and it's one of my prized possessions and so hopefully, in the near future I'll actually get to meet them for real. 
I've been like knitting this scarf for my boyfriend for a while, but it doesn't really seem to be getting anywhere and I just want to finish this ball of yarn, like, before the holidays begin, so I'm just -- I don't -- I don't know. I have no idea what to do and I have no money and I'm just like, blah. But um, once, once December eighteenth is over, my life will be awesome, so, you know, sixteen more days of hell, yeah. 
I hope all is well, I have to go tutor now, but I will see you guys next week.
