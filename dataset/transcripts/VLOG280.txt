It's Saturday, and you're watching XXXX. This week we are talking about what we want to be or what we wanted to be, um, when we grew up. And I don't think it's been that easy a question for everyone, because I think everyone goes through that, uh, you know goes through twenty, thirty time - things that they want to be -- um, just about everyone. I know I've had a lot of things. Um, I had really huge desire to be a singer, like Kaitlin. Um, I never really thought I had what it took to make it so I didn't pursue it in any way. I wanted to be an actress and was really into drama, but oh my gosh, I -- as bad a singer as I am, I am so much worse an actor. Um, but you know I love those things, I do them anyway but, um, but you know, I always thought I'd do something creative. 
If I was gonna -- teaching was the one thing that I actually thought I might go into. I -- I spent a lot of time just not even knowing. Growing up, I really didn't have any one thing I was like, I want to be this. Um, when I got to like high school when you're really supposed to be thinking about these things, I -- I kind of focused on teaching because -- because I love kids, because, um, because it left me open to, um, any field, really, because you can become a teacher of anything so I still -- you saw that bug this time, right -- okay, I'm pretty sure. Okay. Um, anyway, so I could be anything. I could teach anything, so that was kind of my thing. I just never really had anything I really wanted to focus on. More recently, I thought about going back to school for things but, um, I just don't know. The -- the only thing I really would go back to school for is psychology. 
I really find the way people thing fascinating, and if you watch YouTube, you probably do, too, if you watch blogs, because that's really what it's all about, is just kind of people watching without being creepy, you know? There is one thing that I can safely say I always wanted to be. And when I'm asked the question what did you want to be when you grew up, it's usually my answer, because it's -- it's absolute -- it's the one thing that I never wavered on and that is, I wanted to be a mommy. And I live that dream. And I am so -- I feel so fortunate to -- to be able to say I do what I wanted to do when I grew up. I um, I'm really, really blessed that I get to stay home a -- and be with my boy, because I was a nanny before I had kids. 
It was -- it was actually the perfect job, obviously, um, and the fact is I stay -- I ha -- I spent so much more time with these kids than their parents did, and it really made me sad to think that, um, that their parents were missing out on these things. I mean, um, I took care of them from the time they were babies, like, couple months old. I saw first steps, I saw a first word, and I really, I swore I just did not want to be that parent that missed those things, and uh -- not that I'm saying anything bad about those parents because they had to do what they had to do -- um, you know they -- they were just doing what they needed to -- to -- to provide. So, I guess that's about it. Next week -- I'm so excited -- I cannot wait for my Secret Santa present. Thing is like, Kaitlin, I wanna wait. I thought I was gonna have - I was gonna be the only one who was like, open it. I'm a three year old when it comes to Christmas presents. 
I just, I want to open them, I want to shake them, and then rip 'em open. So, um, I hope I don't have to wait to do that. I will video it, of course, that's the point, but I'm not waiting 'till next Saturday. It's just not gonna happen -- it will be after Christmas. How can I wait 'till after Christmas to open it? That's not gonna happen. But um, you know, but what -- I am so much more excited actually. I'm really excited to get my present and just see what, um, what someone would get for me, because I -- because I'm kind of new and not as well known, you know we don't know each other as well, so it will be interesting to see. But, I'm actually really more excited to see everyone else open their presents. Um, I'm a give -- I'm a giver. I'm a taker, too -- come on -- I like to get -- but I just love to give gifts. I love it. 
I wish I was filthy rich because I would just buy everyone presents every day of the year. Anyway, tomorrow's XXXX and then we start Secret Santa Week. It'll be so much fun -- make sure to come watch us open our presents -- isn't that the fun of Christmas anyway? Merry Christmas, everybody.
