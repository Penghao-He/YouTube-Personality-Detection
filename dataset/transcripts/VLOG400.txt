Okay. And my brain basically -- it was too much. And I do get over stimulated to where my -- I get like tunnel vision or just anxiety that's -- I don't know, anyway. Um, and, um, I do remember sensations. I remember some pressure, like a squeeze around my arm. I remember my arm being pulled. And I remember being um, dragged off the bus, my legs somehow keeping up with being pulled. 
And then being stood right in front of the individual who I had, um, yelled at at. And I remember this huge, gigantic, in my perception, woman, um, thirty five feet tall, um, looking down at me and going, "You, apologize right now. " I also remember my bladder giving way around that moment. Um, and so I -- I remember saying something maybe like, oh no, I'm sorry. 
And, uh, then, um, I -- this is more of a faint memory, but I think the same person grabbed me and took me back onto the bus and sat me down, but it was right next to this girl that I don't think she stayed sitting next to me. Go figure. Um, that perhaps there's a little logic. Perhaps I was having one of those really, um, trying to -- like those little adolescent, prepubescent, uh, compulsions to try to show off for a girl. One of those idiotic moments which, um, probably is rather common. 
Um, but, anyway, yeah, I sat and I rode home that day with my soiled pants and got off the bus, went home and then the next day, um, I was called to the principal's office, and he was very calm, actually quite polite. He asked me if I knew why I was there and I said -- I did. I assessed why I was there and he said -- so he told me that we're going to go visit the individual that I had told that to. 
Now, um, back then I would've been the younger version of this, didn't have these on, didn't have any corrective lenses yet. Um, but he told me as I was going and he said -- he looked down at me and he said, "You're going to apologize. I want you to meet this boy. " He said, "Now he might behave a little differently, but um, I want you to, um, know that he's -- he said something like I want you to know he's just another boy just like you -- as you, " or something like that. And I'm like, okay. 
And, um, so I remember him standing there with him and the feeling as though we were holding hands, but I don't know if we were. I just felt like I anchor onto people when I'm nervous, or just even going out to the mall or whatever, I will anchor, like really focus on people, sort of energetically latch onto them as though I'm sort of archly or energy wise holding their hand. Sort of like holding onto their energy. So, maybe at that age I was already doing that, because that's what my memory feels like. 
And I remember the door opening and the instructor calling to the boy and the boy coming up to the door and looking at me and this boy, um, didn't look at me with anger or a scowl. This boy looked at me with a sort of smile. Um, but of -- with concern, and I looked at the boy and I said um, I just said I'm sorry, you know, and before I could do anything, I was being hugged by this other little boy. And back then I was -- I remember like standing stiff, kinda rigid, but also -- all I felt was acceptance. And, uh, respect, um, pretty unconditional. Not -- so, anyway, that was very, very touching obviously. 
Um, it's two o-eight. Let's see what time I got here. And it gave me my first kind of realization of how incorrect these other persons were to tell me that this person was retarded. And in no way shape or form of retardo. Perhaps in ways I'm far more enlightened, soul was in a body. Um, so anyway, that experience has stuck with me for years. It'll probably be with me 'til I leave this body and probably eternally to some degree. 
Um, so I feel the energies of others, strongly. Sympathizing, though when they do something of their own choice, um, that probably has consequences that aren't healthy for them or whatever, um, I --
