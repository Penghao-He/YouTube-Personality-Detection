Hello, YouTube. It's XXXX here. I just realized I haven't made, like, sort of, proper, talky, video thing in a while. Well then, like me and XXXX made some other ones, so you can go on her account to watch that. So I'm gonna put up mine, but, no; it takes so long to load, and basically. 
Uh, yeah, sorry about clown makeup, by the way. I was doing a thing for my friend's media, so I was like, I'm gonna put on lipstick, and I'll be like the next colorful person or something. And then it turned out that I was going to become so the whole, like, lipstick -- it didn't really work. But, , I dunno. 
But yeah, so, um, basically, I've -- I'm still alive and stuff and I'm making videos, which is cool. And, um, two things I wanted to chat about 'cause they are both serious matters. Okay, first of all, the Galaxy adverts, that, you know, Galaxy chocolate. All of those dumb adverts are just women like, I love my chocolate; I'm gonna eat a whole bar of it. Like, every single woman, it's like, ever made, I swear. Like, correct me if I'm wrong; maybe there's been one where a guy has been like, I fucking love Galaxy. But most of them, if not all of them, are just these chicks, like, hiding their chocolate so other chicks can't steal it. Like the most recent one, where these women like, I love books and I love chocolate. And it's like, girls don't just eat chocolate. Like, we're not just crazy onto chocolate. Sorry. dodgy. Girls don't like weird, fucking, gonna be like, yeah, chocolate. Like, I dunno, it's just stupid, fucking stereotype and it irritates me a little bit. So it's just like -- I dunno maybe I'm just making a fuss over nothing -- but it's kinda like, can we not with the whole constantly being chicks fucking eating chocolate on their own. It's like we are not such bad people, seriously. 
Also another thing, I'll find it, 'cause -- I don't remember the link. My mate showed me; then he was gonna show me something else and then he found that, so he was like, watch it. But it's some guy called, I dunno; his mate was called Cougarman , but I think he was called Big Man. But they did some version of, um, , but the Cougman guy had the right idea. He was taking the call and saying like, what the fuck is my mate doing? I think it was on . But, Big Man guy, he was like doing some version of Lady Gaga just dance, but it's just basically him being like, pull your pants down, suck my dick, mirror me, I've got all my bitches and I'm going to change women now. And it's like, honey, for real, like, just from what I've seen with the whole drug and he's not much of a looker -- it's, like, there's one bit where he's just like, um -- uh, bitch, get all fumbled, I'm gonna find another girl to suck my dick. But it's like, be happy with the one, and you don't need to sing about it. It's like, congrats' that you are getting some action. Yeah, I'm -- I'm pleased for you and all that, but don't kill Lady Gaga, please. Her music is good. I like it. I don't want you to piss all over it with your crap. Pretty much. 
Like, as bitchy as that sounds, like, I'm sure he's a lovely person in real life, but, like, seriously; don't put that crap on the internet. No one wants to see it. And rich, coming from me, 'cause I'm putting a video of me just talking on the internet. But I'm not being unasked, and I'm not killing a good song, so just leave it. But, um, yeah. So that's two things that I found annoying. 
And, um, anyone watching this who wants good music to listen to, they should check out the Millionaires. They're pretty fierce. Wait, I'll play a bit of them now actually. Wait, finding it. Yeah, so this is them. And they're really awesome, and, um, yeah, I like them. And you should listen to them 'cause they'e really cute, and it's all pretty fierce, but yeah. I think that's about it and, um, I dunno; that's about it. Also a big shout out to XXXX, because she's fabulous and just because I've been talking to her and stuff and she's cute. And, um, can't really think of anything else to talk about, to be honest. 
Apart from that thing with the Pope, chatting about how condoms is increased the AIDS epidemic or something, like, don't know what he's all about. Like, once again, I'm have nothing against the Pope himself; it's just the second time something he said has been kind of silly, to say the least. But yeah, Pope needs to sort his things out, 'cause now everyone's going to be like, oh, if condoms makes the whole getting AIDS chance higher; I'm not going to use one. Then tons of people are gonna get AIDS, all because of the Pope. So like, yeah, I don't know what he thinks he's doing. And then some crazy bitch was on some show chatting about how condoms make AIDS worse as well, and it's -- it's -- it's silly basically. Like, yeah, please get your facts straight before you chat about that kind of thing on TV. 
And, um, hmm, yeah, I don't think I have anything else to talk about actually. Sorry, this video, me being like , but I dunno. Um, gonna stop fighting that. Yeah, I think that's about it really. Yeah, it's all happy YouTubing, guys. I'll make a more interesting video next time. Love. .
