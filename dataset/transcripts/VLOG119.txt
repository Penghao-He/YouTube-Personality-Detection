Hey everyone, I'm 's mom, um, I'm also known as XXXX, um. Okay, so this is my first video so I'm a little nervous and it might be a little retarded, but, um, after talking to XXXX, which I'm sure most of you've been -- you know, um, she told me to make one, and I did. 
So, um, I just got back from, um, the Food Network Night, um, with a couple of moms and it was delicious, the food was amazing. Like, I made, um, , um, strawberry and peach cobbler, and it was a little rubbery. The cobbler really didn't come up, like stayed at the bottom so it was -- it was good, but it was like rubbery. Um, then I also made potatoes, which were also really, really good. Then everybody else made awesome recipes and I'm stuffed, and it's one thirty in the morning and I'm making a video, um, but I figure since my hair was kinda nice, um, that I would make a video now instead of tomorrow. 
Um, and it's in black and white because, um, it doesn't show the flaws, but don't tell anybody that. Um, so I'm gonna try to blog, not every day, but sometimes see how I like it. If I get I great response I'll continue, if not then I won't. Um, I really don't want to make videos that no one reply to them or nothing, because then that's stupid. I'll just feel dumb, so we'll see how it goes. 
Um, I even thought about doing a, um, blog for coupons, because I am a coupon freak. I'm one of those ladies that stand at the check out lane for thirty minutes while they scan my coupons. Um, I do purchases like before coupons to a hundred and something dollars, up to coupons lower than twenty bucks. So I'm really like crazy about them, so I figure I could maybe teach some few people on here, if I get some interest. If not, then I'll just make goofy videos. Um, and I really don't know how to edit videos, but I'm gonna try and we'll see what I can come up with. 
Um, I think that's it for now. Um, like I said its one thirty in the morning; I probably should get some sleep since I have no child tonight, um, so I hope that you guys enjoy this video.
