This is Sunday, the twenty first of December. Yes, and I'm really sorry I haven't been away -- around for a really long time. I really don't have any decent excuse for not being so, other than that I've had a lot what to do. I don't anymore because it's my Christmas holidays, which is lovely. And my teacher has been clipping me in because some of us are doing retakes next year, just in January, so they're giving us some time to do all our revision. And we're taking one English exam on Pride and Prejudice from last year and I'm doing a new English exam on The Rape of the Lock and She Stoops to Conquer. So I'm doing a lot of revision for that. And I've got one essay to do. So it's not that much, which is nice. 
Um, I briefly mentioned in my video yesterday that I received two investee offers: one from Sussex, and one from Kent. Sussex I didn't expect them to want three A's for definite, especially since I'm not predicting three A's and um but I'm not too bothered because I didn't really want to go to Sussex. So, um, yeah. Not that bothered by it. But I did get an offer from Kent, and they want only three hundred and twenty points, which is the equivalent of an A and two B's and they didn't want any in English, which is I think might be doable, which is quite encouraging. The only problem would be that if I don't receive any more offers, um, well I'd have to put Sussex as my first choice, because you shouldn't have a second choice which one's higher grades than your first. Your insurance choice should always be lower. So it all can get quite confusing but, um, hopefully I'll hear back from some other universities fairly soon. That would be nice, but I don't expect it as it's the Christmas holidays now. 
Speaking of which, I haven't been feeling that Christmassy. I'm beginning to feel more so now, 'cause I keep hearing Christmas music and I think not hearing it for a few days has been a nice break and is actually giving me a lot of Christmas spirit and, um, I did briefly go to Buthland Abbey with my family today, very briefly. But this is the very lovely barn with the huge Christmas tree. I really don't have very much else to say today. So you should see me on Friday, which is the day after Christmas day. Happy Christmas everyone.
