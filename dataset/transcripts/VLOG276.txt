Hey, YouTube. Um, I have been thinking a lot about relationships and relations with different people. Um, I learned a lot this summer and recently about -- mostly about, like, how different people create different relationships and how multiple different people can cause relationships to end weird or be weird. I don't know -- I -- I struggle with different kinds of relationships, personally, ah, because of the way I grew up, but that's not always the case, and I'm not, like, using it as an excuse. It's more like family relationships. I'm just talking about, like, friends. Um, I made a mistake this summer and at that point in time it was like the best thing I thought to do, and what I felt was right, and maybe there was too much emotion going on, ah, for me personally. Uh, it's -- it's --it's like a -- like a weird, tricky balance that you -- is hard to -- to deal with sometimes. 
I don't really, I don't know. I struggle with relationships every day of my life. It's 'cause they take work, and I -- it takes a lot of guts and a lot of want to fix something after you broke it, intentionally, unintentionally, whatever. Um, 'cause sometimes people make mistakes and they're not quite sure why, and they didn't -- or they didn't think it was a mistake at the time. Um, like my brother called me yesterday and it sounded like he wanted a different -- I have an older brother who I have negative and positive emotions towards -- and he sounded like he wanted to, um, like, build a relationship again, I guess, or, like, he needed something from me. He wanted something from me, but I didn't really feel like I needed to give that to him. 'Cause I wasn't sure it was, and I don't really have very many emotions for him I guess, now. 
And maybe I'm not ready, uh, and so even when it comes to friends, I -- I learned a lot about what kind of friends I want, and what kinds I need, and what kinds I don't, uh, and, I'm not opposed to owning up to my mistakes -- that's not the issue -- it's more like -- I don't know, just not getting other people to understand mistakes, and, like, being able to explain where you were coming from and -- 'cause to me -- to emotions get wrapped up in it. Uh, I don't know, it's hard. It's, like, you don't know how much effort you should put forth for a relationship of any kind. Um, most -- most right now I'm talking about friendships, because I -- I had a group of friends this summer that I did something that I didn't view as necessarily wrong, and it just started to get disbanded, and then apparently I got distant. 
I mean what really happened is; I just started spending more time with other people, or I was working full time; I mean, that's the other thing that happened. I don't know. I just get super confused. And it -- it does take a lot of guts just to, you know, call someone up and be like, yes, what I did wrong. Um, and then you have to weigh out if that's really necessary, but I mean honestly I guess another good way to think about something, or anything in life is, what do you really have to lose? Usually, you don't have anything to lose because you've already lost it, or you never had it before in the beginning anyway. But, it's just sort of, like, having enough courage to -- I don't know -- um, go about that and actually go and do it, is the hardest part, and that's kind of what I'm trying to figure out now. 
It's like, who's -- who's most of my relationships, actually? It's like, what is the pro and con of -- of me, you know, putting myself out there, and like, trying this. Because, more often than not, it's not going to be the -- the outcome that I want. And, like, I do miss people, and I may have messed up, but it's, like, I make one mistake and -- and to them it might have been huge -- and I'm sorry about that, but it's just, like, I made one mistake and it's like everything was poked through -- it gets thrown out the window. And, like, an example of me not forgiving someone, or me not really wanting to build a relationship anymore with my parents, because kind of just the way that all went down, it's much bigger than one mistake it's, you know, fourteen years mistakes, it's a long time. 
And my brother thinks I need to speak to -- it's just all -- all these relationship issues seem to be coming up, and I -- I'm not the relationship expert, obviously, I -- I -- I kind of fail. But, I do try. I'm only nineteen, it's not like I'm spectacular at life right now. I don't know. So, it's just, like, trying to weight out pros and cons, and trying to figure out who, uh, is going to be most beneficial. That is my update for now. I will update, uh, more often, hopefully, and I hope everyone is doing well.
