Okay. So it's not kind of shining, but just forget that. Um, hello everybody. I am making a video because I have nothing else to do but I really don't know what to talk about, so I'm just going to go with the flow here. 
First of all, look at my amazing shirt. It's a peace shirt. I got that from Hot Topic when I went. Oh, I went out of town this past week and I went to, um, with my mom and yeah, I had a lot of fun. It's kinda boring, 'cause like, you know, I'm vegetarian, right? And it's, like, really, really hard to find a vegetarian alternative at places. You know, cause you usually I don't eat out anymore really. I used to eat stuff at the house so it was kind of tricky with that. I think I probably lost a couple of pounds, but yeah. So that is all with that. My mom did pretty good I think and yeah, so, I don't really -- I don't really have anything, really have anything going on right now. Um, yeah. 
Let's see, my birthday is coming up very soon. But it is actually a friend of mine's birthday, his name is Ryan and, um, I was going to say happy birthday on here and so happy birthday and he probably doesn't watch this but I don't really care. I'm just going to say it anyways. But my birthday is real soon. I'll be seventeen. I think I already said that on my past video. I don't know but I'm getting excited for it and this is great news, everybody. I am not afraid to talk on the phone anymore, and, I got a Skype so anybody who wants my Skype or something or just wants to talk to me on Skype, ask me and I will give it to you. Okay? And we'll talk on there. So yeah, that was probably all for now, just a little update you know, stuff like that. Uh, phbbbth, don't know. 
My hair -- I my hair earlier and it's becoming like an afro, really bad and I don't know what to do. I want to get a haircut but I don't want it really short because this is with gel and it looks good with gel still. And then like a little, a little, uh, like frizzy but that's about it so, yeah. I will probably make another video soon, and I will talk to you all later.
