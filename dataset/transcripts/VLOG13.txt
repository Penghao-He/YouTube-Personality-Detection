Hello, so I'm -- keep looking at myself. Um, I just saw the new Lady Gaga video for her song, Bad Romance and uh, I have to say I thought it was actually pretty -- pretty cool, um, there was a few things that I want to address though. 
Um, there's this part where you see her spine and it looks like -- when you see the video, you see her spine when she's like in the shower thing or whatever and that just kinda freaked me out a little bit, just saying. 
Um, and she was wearing Alexander McQueen, um the shoes from his most recent runway, the Devil's Hooves as I call them. I thought that was pretty cool that she did that and um, let's see. I love how it looks really good quality right there but I'm pretty sure as soon as I upload it, it's gonna look all gritty. Um, just gonna go for it. Um, hmm, uh, yeah okay, back to the video. I'm just trying to collect my thoughts. 
Um, I just -- I just saw it like maybe five seconds ago. Seriously, like five seconds ago I saw it and I was -- I just had to make a video and tell you that I thought it was actually pretty good and I didn't really understand the concepts. She was like a vampire prostitute, who was being sold off to the highest bidder, and then she kills him at the end by setting him on fire? Is that the concept or is that what the plot of it is? Is that the synapsis, synopsis, synopses? 
Um, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm really bored. I didn't go to school today 'cause I didn't feel good and um, Twitter was all Lady Gaga, Bad Romance, so the video just premiered like, today, so I -- well, on YouTube at least, I've never seen it on TV. Then again, do they really play videos on TV anymore? Not really. 
But, um, overall I thought the music was really good. Um, Lady Gaga doesn't really have that great of a range, in my opinion, but I thought she did some really interesting things with her voice, like a whole, part, I thought that was pretty cool. But um, yeah. 
I don't know, just overall I thought it was pretty interesting. I don't want to say like its amazing or anything, but I don't want to say it's terrible, I just think it's pretty interesting. And um, that's all .
