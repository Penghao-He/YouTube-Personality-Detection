You know what? I think it is entirely reasonable for me to place the blame for my behavior tonight on mee maw and pa paw. 
I just -- I don't think that they gave me enough attention. I don't think that I've had enough attention as a child, you know? You know, support from them as a child and now I act out as a way of getting attention -- of gaining some kind of parental approval, you know? 
I just want people to love me, you know? I mean isn't that what we all want? We just want people to love us and that's really, like, I just want people to love me. 
I wish I had a --a bigger upper lip like my mom. I think it's fine. I just I wish I had a -- yeah, mmm, I need a song! 
Oh my God. That's like a fucking -- I had an Austin Bright in my head. Like, when I'm taking pictures and stuff like that, like, I can't stay still. Like, if I'm waking for the camera to click off I'm, like, I don't if that's a human person or if it's just some, like, alien person. I really do believe that I'm a alien or a robot or something, one of them. Because like you people, I -- I haven't quite fully learned how to integrate, you know, human cultural cues, into my system, into my program, and you know? It's, like, a foreign language to me that I'm still learning. I haven't fully integrated ever since I was dropped here, you know? 
Actually, I think that I fell from, like, a shooting star, like, flying across the universe or something like that, and, like, I fell and somehow I landed on your fucking planet, and, like, I just happened to land in a woman's womb and just popped out, like, nine months later, and, like, I'm a fucking alien, so we are not the same. 
Has anyone stopped to think about just how weird you are as a person? Like, if you -- if you don't think that you're weird, then that's whack. You -- you're pretty whack, and I don't wanna be your friend, because I like weird people. Everybody has their quirks that makes them so weird. Like, people are just weird, like, I don't know if I'm the only one that knows it that people are just weird. I think it's because I notice how weird I am, it probably cues me in how weird other people are. I think that's how it works, sometimes. I'm -- I'm watching my back . 
What're you doing here? I better stop saying that. A lot of people have been sending me messages on -- since I've been gone. Yes, I have been absent and um, YouTube is not my life, you know? I just have other things to do so, um, get off my Austin nuts all right? Shit. I'll post a video when I want to, damn. That is so rude, but whatever, this is my show, okay? All has been paid for and it's mine. 
Oh yeah, and this woman, she was like, she was really an older woman and she was hitting on me, and she was, like, you know, you come off a little bit gay in your videos. I don't know if you intend to or not. And, I was, like, well, I am gay. Yeah, I'm gay. Me and the peen, we have an um, long standing relationship, we have a contract, you know? 
Every now and then. I had to spit, excuse me. It wasn't really spit. I had just ate some, you know, those little pizza roll things that you pop in the microwave and then, like, a minute or two minutes later it pops out, fifteen delicious bites of pizza. Delicious ness, you know what I'm saying? I just had one of those. I had one with, uh, meat. Like meat. Not the kind of meat that I would like to be fucking, there, but you know what, that was inappropriate. 
So, first of all, I am crazy. So if you think I'm crazy, then it's true. I am crazy. But crazy in a good way, like, crazy in a, you know, I need to be crazy to free myself because I'm a very reserved person. Like, I don't know if you now noticed it, but I'm a very reserved person. I am. And I hate that. It's, like, I have this inner urge to be so exuberating, gregarious, and outgoing, but then I get in those, you know, in an alien situation where I'm around human beings, and it's like I don't understand what people are saying. 
It's, like, I haven't -- I don't know, I just -- I'm a on my head at one point, and now I can no longer understand how to be a participant in human -- in society and so I observe so I can learn how to fully integrate myself into society. And I don't remember what my original point was, because I just start rambling about, you know, being a freaking alien in human society because I've always felt sometimes, you know? 
I'm trying to see how long this video is because I'm really not trying to make a long video. I just want to, like, babble and put something on the YouTube just to be, like, yo, I'm still here. I'm working very hard. Um, well, that's a fucking lie. I'm working. Um, I try to write everyday. I do. And I've had some major setbacks even though I've had some brilliant revelations, um, and I'm working on something right now that's put together brilliantly. It is, like, all of the plans that I have for all of the books that I wanted to write are coming together into one book, and it is amazing. It is amazing. And, um, I hope that people will love it when they get it, when I finally, you know, happen to get it into the hands of an agent. And an agent gets it into the hands of a publisher. And then the publisher to an editor. And then the editor actually has it published. I'm -- I'm -- I know it's gonna be amazing. I know it will. And I just -- I'm looking forward for the day when I can walk into a bookstore and see my name on the book, on the shelf. The shelf. And then I'll go on Oprah or Ellen, you know, and the whole audience will get free shit. Damn! 
But yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know why I do this. I don't know why I do this. It's, like, late at night when I couldn't -- well, I can't cook right now. I'm currently in my brother's room, okay? Sh, don't tell nobody, but I'm broke. I can't really do anything and it's really heartbreaking when you really want to be out there and -- but you just don't have the money. It -- it breaks my heart to be in the house. I don't like to be in the house. Like, I used to be such a homebody. Ask people who know me, like, a year or two ago, and I was such a homebody. It wasn't, like, I didn't even want to go out to party, but like, I was just, like, well you know, we can, but now it's just, like, yeah, let's fucking party, let's get drunk bitch, let's get drunk. Let's get drunk, aahh, yeah! 
Um, somebody needs to shave. My dad has massive armpit hair and my mom likes it. I'm just, like, gross, woman. I will never lay in my man's armpit hair. Ugh, and chest hair, I don't wanna see it. Ever. Ever. Okay? I don't wanna see chest hair, I don't wanna feel chest hair, I don't want chest hair. You better wax. Um, I don't know where that came from. 
So, I have nothing else to say. You better -- I don't know if this looks good on camera but in the mirror, this whole get up, like, it really works for me. I feel like such a -- this is so California right now. You know, I feel -- I'm feeling real California, West Coast in the hizz ouse. 
Yeah, we're not talking anymore, this is just -- this is just ranting. This is just entertainment for your late night, you know? When you don't have anything to do, turn to me and I'll be here to entertain you. Well, not really to entertain. I don't know if I'm entertaining, but I'll be here to talk about nonsensical shit, you know what I'm saying? That's what I live for, okay? I am here for you, I am. 
You know Cancer, we are the ultimate hosts on the Zodiac. We are the mother of the Zodiac, okay? We are. We love to nurture, we love to care, we love to hope, we love to be -- you know make everybody feel like part of the family, it's just what we do. So if I can help you in any way feel comfortable, you know, then hey, hey, I've done my job, all right. 
All right, so I'm signing off right now. So, deuces. Working Monday . You know me. 
I just watched the video that you just finished watching and I said XXXX -- XXXX, you are -- you are a mess. You really are a mess. You need -- this is my therapy, you know? Well, I'm doing something I have to do, you know? I have to do this or I -- I to do. If I don't get it out, I'll just go crazy. So I got to get it out. Yeah, I do have to get it out or else I'm gonna go crazy. I'll go bananas, 'cause I hold it in. There's so much and it's holding in. I mean, if I'm find -- if you -- XXXX, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. But I have to get the crazy out. I have to get the crazy out. 
All right, um. I have nothing more to say, so deuces again. Okay, this is the last -- I'm gonna kill the mic, I swear. So I just watched that last bit that I did and I'm saying, yes, bitch. You better be the sexiest mother I know. You better. You better be it, okay? You betta. And that's it -- so I just wanted to add that onto the end. All right.
