Hi, everyone. How's it going? I've been debating for quite some time now what sort of video I should be putting up next. I've got a few concepts for a few serious videos and I felt the need to do a funny one first, but it just wasn't happening. 
I am working a new job now, as many of you perhaps know already, for the BBC, for their comedy department. It is a dream come true and it's a privilege to be working with a team of great people. Uh, and it's been really, really good fun. If you want to see the sort of stuff I've been working on, then there is a link of their channel. If you click it, you can see it and comment and whatever you do comment on a video or on the channel, um, the likelihood is that I will see it, so um, yeah. 
But in general lately, um, I've been through another crazy point in my life and some of you here remember watching my videos from last year -- it was on the lead up to Christmas, and I'm going through the motions at the moment and I just haven't had a chance to stop and, you know, relax and get on with, you know, the things I used to, like make YouTube videos. 
So this is just a quick update video to say that if you don't see videos from me for a while, this is why. I hope to come back very, very soon. Uh, and if you do want to stay in touch and up to date, because I still do my live shows, um, and I do still come along -- online from time to time uh, the best way is for you to Twitter. I update that and I will always be posting info of when I'm doing projects, et cetera. Um, whether it's at my work at the BBC or if it's a live show or if it's just anything of particular interest. 
I do want to come back and make videos, um, but I'm just going to have to put that off at the moment. So, I've been getting a lot of emails the past few weeks asking when I'm going to be making another video and instead of answering them individually I just thought I'd put this up here for the meantime. 
So thank you everyone for the support, and I hope to see you soon. And if it's in the new year, I hope you have a great Christmas uh, and to a happy new year. Bye.
