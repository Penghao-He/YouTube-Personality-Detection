All right. Well, uh, turn to your textbooks in, uh, page twenty yeah. Now, the thing we are going to talk about the Spaniards. And, you guys know, the Spaniards were -- they were Catholic, you know. Uh, I went to a Catholic, uh, school -- Catholic school, uh, you know. But, I was cool. I was a cool Catholic kid, you know. 
I had dreadlocks and, you know, I -- I wore rusty colors. It was -- I was the back in the day. I still am you know, I can skate board, you know. 
 because you gotta get serious, because you have A. P. test that means you have to pass. 
Okay, something I hate about my school, hmm, this is going to be a long list, so I'm going to spare you guys and I'm only gonna name one thing. My school is a uniform enforced school. We have a uniform dress code. Fun, I know. And, um, you know, they're pretty strict about it. I just -- I hate it, because they actually pay people to stay at the front gates and make sure you are in uniform. Because of that, I also hate the faculty. Every single one of them, even the teachers. Yeah. 
One thing that I actually like about, um, my school is the schedule, you know, 'cause we -- our schedule is weird. It's not just like one through seven every single day. It's -- we have blocks. So, um, every other day we have either the even numbered periods or the odd numbered periods. So, Monday would be like one, three, five and seven, and then Tuesday would be two, four, six and eight. Yeah, the classes are longer, but you kind of just learn how to deal with them. But, it gives you more time to do homework; we get more breaks and yeah. Okay, see you guys next week, or will I? Hmmm.
