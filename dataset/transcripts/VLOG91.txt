Hey guys, this is XXXX, coming to you from the XXXX channel on YouTube. Now today, I just wanted to discuss with you the three main operating systems that people use. 
Okay, the main reason I'm doing this video is to try to use Sony Vegas which I barely got. It's pretty confusing, but so are girls, so whatever. But yeah, so I basically asked people what their favorite operating system was and I got a quite a few responses on Twitter, but I chose three that popped out to me and that is from Yadda yadda . He says, I'm a PC that wishes I'm a Mac. Lags way too much, but that may be a RAM problem. Yeah, I've heard a lot about um -- I can tell -- I can tell you from personal experience that Vista takes up a lot of RAM. I mean, they say that it needs minimum two gigabytes of RAM to operate, but it really takes up like, three to four, which sucks. 
Um, and the person that sent me a response was Nixypic --
﻿I thought that was a pretty funny response, so that's why I included that. And um, Jimmy Tryon on Twitter writes, um, that he uses Windows and Linux. 
I use Mac for doing video and audio production, and, you know, we've seen in recent years that Macs have pretty much become the standard for video and audio production. 
So now I'm posing the question to you, the viewer. What do you like to use personally? Windows, Macs, maybe Linux? Tell me.
