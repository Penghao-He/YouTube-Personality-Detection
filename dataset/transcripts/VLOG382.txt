﻿Hi, everyone. It's XXXX here. And I've decided to be a bit more enthusiastic for my videos. And also for today, because something happened to me. Something incredible, masterful, amazing, outstanding, awesome, incredible. Okay, I've lost words basically. But let's get more to the point. 
My parents, um, just bought me something. It's in a white bag, and it's got a big Apple logo on it and it's making me dribble. That means something my parents have just given me is from Apple. So I opened it gently, and I got Snow Leopard. OMG, and it's got iLife o nine and iWork o nine. Incredibly I'm dribbling, mouth watering and ecstatic. That means, I'm -- this, my computer I'm using now has hardly anything compared to Snow Leopard. And I bet you even if I put it on my old one which is running behind you, and has about thirteen minutes until the end of installation, that this will still be ten times better. And that computer is older. Just remember that. 
Alright. Enough of that. Back to something serious. As you can see, I'm wearing a completely ridiculous hat, that's because my grandmother bought it for me and it's actually really, really warm. Figured. 
News, there's a party on tonight and I don't know if I should go. I've been trying to call everyone and nobody that I know is going. So far, only one guy though, but I'm not sure if it's the best idea to go. That means I've run out of ideas and towards the end of this vlog. So I'll see you all later don't forget it's probably going to be typing on the bottom, now, starting now. Don't forget to check my Twitter account. I go on it regularly and I've been posting more and more comments. I know that some of you are very annoyed that I don't have any comments on Twitter and stuff, but it's because I'm lazy and I'm a bit boring. And also go to the Billum zero five six seven websites and the billum zero five six seven dot pics or dot com yadda, yadda ya thing and I will be typing again on the bottom, and that's it. So, thanks everyone for watching. Don't forget to please subscribe. I hope you enjoy the new intro. I know a lot of you wanted a new intro and never had an intro, so hope this works. Bye.
