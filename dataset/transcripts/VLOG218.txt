So, even though my dear friend could not be here with us right now, I will show you a photo of the stocking that she -- she did make. That should be going up some where in front of my face, now. Yeah, soak it in, that's right, boom, not just any stalking, a uh, a uh tube sock stocking. Go XXXX. And of course, you know, I had to make something bizarre and seemingly clever, in my own opinion, and so I made, oh goodness, I made a, um, stocking for an octopus. There you go. It is an eight legged stocking for an octopus because I think -- you know they want to celebrate under the sea, right? But don't fret kiddies, it does have an actual like stocking hole so it's a fully functional, uh, stocking for octopi. I think that's, yes -- that's plural for octopus, right? 
I'm going to talk a little bit quieter now. As far as what I want for Christmas, honestly, it sounds so sappy and it sounds so like rehearsed but I don't know, there is nothing that I really want. I mean you can ask my parents. I haven't asked for anything for Christmas because, aw, it sounds lame but the things I want for Christmas you can't like put a price on. Like I just want to be in good health. I want my friends to be happy, all of my family to be safe. I want to be successful at what I do. I want to come up with cool ideas and -- I don't know, those are what I want right now. As far as material go I -- I don't know, I'm pretty blessed and I have -- like I have what I want. I can't really think of anything else like a possession or something that I need. I just -- I mean of course I would love more books. I would love more movies and music and things like that, but nothing that I want badly enough to just like, put on list, and ask somebody to buy it for me. So I don't know, I don't really have a -- a Christmas list. I literally have not made one and I haven't asked for anything because, uh, anyways at random, and like don't let me guilt you into thinking that you're -- you're not supposed to want a Christmas list. It's totally cool if you want stuff for Christmas. If you want all of that cool stuff, by all means, write your little heart out to Santa until you -- your little heart can't write no more. I don't know if you can tell, but I'm tired. So, I am going to end this video. It is-- well Apple says it is one ten in the morning, so I am going to edit this and get some sleep. By sleep I mean watch some more Supernatural on DVD until it is a stupid hour in the morning, and then wish that I didn't stay up that long. Happy Holidays. 
﻿So first and foremost, XXXX couldn't be part of the vlog portion this time around because my camera actually died while we were at her house. She did, however, give me a list of things she wanted for Christmas, but I suck and I don't think I took the list with me, so I'm gonna try to remember what was on it. 
She wanted rocket powered something. Yeah, some kind of appliance that's like powered by rockets. Confusingly enough, I also think she wanted the first season of Rocket Power on DVD. She could have put Boy Meets World on DVD, maybe? Sere -- I am such a bad friend. 
Me and XXXX are just artistic masochists, who decided to keep drawing, even though it's not part of the challenge. Bottom line is, after we were done with our stockings, we continued drawing and we both did, uh, Santa Claus. Now, the first Santa Claus I'm gonna show you is the one XXXX made. Whoa bang. So this is XXXX's sexy Santa. He's got liver spots, a not so happy trail, fishnets, a cookie hand, cool nips, stretch marks, a cookie gut -- oh and a happy in cookie hand. I took a different route and I am not a lover like sexy Santa, I am a fighter. So I made brutal Santa.
