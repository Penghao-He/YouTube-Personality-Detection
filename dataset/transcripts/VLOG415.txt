Hey, everyone. I'm going to try and make videos of me now and then on English. And it's not going to be, like, beginner beginner lessons, but, um, things that -- more phrases in English that you might not understand when people use them. And, for now, I have three phrases to share. And if you have any questions about English, you can just ask me, and I'll try my best to answer it. 
The first one is when someone says, "The alarm went off. " Now, when I first heard this, it didn't make sense to me, because actually, the alarm is going -- is turning on. But in English, that -- you just don't say, "The alarm turned on. " For some reason, you say, "The alarm went off. " I don't have an explanation for this, but it's just one of those things, like, we say, "My nose is running, " and, um, "Your feet smell. " It's just weird. And then you could say the same for a sprinkler "went off, " or the bomb "went off. "
The next phrase is, um, "turn off the light, " versus "close the light. " Now, whenever you will hear a native English speaker say this, they would most probably say "close the light. " It's one of the most common mistakes English speakers make. They would say, "Close the light. " "Close the TV. " Something like that. And -- but it's actually supposed to be "turn off the light. " If you can remember to say, "Turn off the light, " instead of "close the light, " it would make you sound a lot more smarter. It's not like someone will tell you that you're wrong. Very few people know that, um, it's "turn off the light, " not "close the light. " This phrase is usually done with a lot of electronics, like, "Close the TV. " But it is, "Turn off the light. " The same goes for "turn on the light. " It's not "open the light. " It's "turn on the light. "
The last one I have for now is "keep me in the loop. " Sometimes when a friend or family member is going somewhere far off, um, they would -- they would tell you, "Keep me in the loop. " Which basically means, keep me aware, let me know, keep me -- keep in touch. Those kind of things. They all mean "keep me in the loop. " So you can say all those things by saying, "Keep me in the loop. " And I'm guessing this might have developed from the term "friend circle. " That's just my guess; I'm not -- I don't know. For now, that's all I have, so -- but if you have any specific questions, you can ask me through YouTube.
