Guess who's procrastinating? I am. There's a really loud airplane. I kind of haven't been here, I'm sorry about that. I've had exams last week and I have another -- another one this week and the which is a three hour exam for -- I don't know why, and I think it's a total waste of time, but we'll see how that goes. And if you've got exams as well, good luck, hope you're doing well. 
Um, I don't know why I point over my shoulder when I say last week and this week. Anyway, um, and after this video I probably won't be here for the next month, because I have my final killer exam ever and I've kind of been neglecting piano because of school exams and I kind of burnt my hand yesterday, because, um, I was serving soup. I'll explain this later. I was serving soup and my dad walked into me and then the soup fell and I just, like, dropped the bowl and ran off and stuck it under cold water. But my dad called me weak for the next two hours just because he refused to admit that it was his fault, so then he's was like shhhh, you can't handle pain. I was like, yeah, it was your fault, God. Um, but yes, I was serving soup because my grandma's cousin's son and daughter are here. Um, I think they're my second cousins once removed because they're my dad's generation. Um, so if somebody understands family trees, would they care to explain to me who they are to me because they -- they are related to me, you know. If you're Asian, I mean, everybody's related to you. 
Sorry to butt in. I found out after they left that they're actually my grandma's cousins, not my grandma's cousin's kids. They're just the same age as my dad. My dad calls them uncle and auntie. I've been calling them great uncle and auntie the entire time. It's just I didn't know because my mom sort of tells me to say whatever in a foreign language. I could have been calling them streetlamp -- I wouldn't know. Um, I actually called their kids uncle and auntie, and their kids are like twelve or something, so, well I guess if you want to get technical, they're not -- they're my cousins. Okay, not going to get technical, but the good thing about when people come over -- they give you gifts. I got a hundred bucks and a really expensive necklace and trust me to be, you know, more in love with the packaging, because how cool is this? Two colors. I think it's cool with the ribbons and the thing, yeah. I usually disregard the gift and go for the wrappings, so, yep. 
Um, and because I have just been procrastinating for the past like, three hours, um, I picked up this mascara because my mom always buys -- she always orders stuff and it comes with free gift things and she just gives them all to me. I was reading this and it goes, in case of an eye irritation, discontinue use and see your ophthalmologist at once, because everybody has an ophthalmologist, you know. They assume that people who buy high class stuff have ophthalmologists. I assume that's some kind of eye doctor, but really why don't -- go see a doctor. It's not like you can get into a specialist person without a doctor referral anyway. 
Yes. And other than that I think I should go back to studying and I think I have to catch the bus pretty soon anyway, um, 'cause my parents have left me at home and taken out my -- my second cousin, once removed, to Red Hill, the winery, and then they were going to go eat dinner at night time. Sorry, did I say eat dinner at night time? I think I meant eat dinner in the morning because when else do you eat dinner? Because, you know, if you're Asian, you go eat dinner when people come over. 
It's me again, the less cool version of me in a grey jumper. She's also quite uncool. Okay, I was saying I burnt myself on soup. The next day I burnt myself on coffee because I was out. I went to Gloria Jean's and bought myself a small caramel latte, four dollars and five cents. Definitely didn't put the lid on properly, um, because the coffee ended up everywhere except for where it should have ended up, in my tummy. Um, I was in public, so I tried to run away as inconspicuously and quickly as I could, but it didn't go down so well because it was on the floor. It was all over me, um, and I burnt my thumb. 
And then today, don't -- don't ever try and staple about a hundred pages together at once, it doesn't work. Um, I -- 'cause we're allowed to bring in notes for our exams and I had to staple this together. I stapled them into three chunks and then I stapled the chunks together, and it looked a bit, you know, like this. It's quite graceful looking. Um, and then I was trying to do that thing where you try and get as many papers together as possible without snapping a staple and that was the result. Um, and I guess before the exam, I was holding it like this, with my finger over it, and I guess I decided to move really fast and then I ripped a hole in my finger. So yeah, just don't try and staple things especially if you're me, um, which none of you are. 
So that's my list of injuries for this week. I will see how many times I run my finger through a staple in the rest of my life. I'll keep you updated.
