Hey, everybody. So before you immediately decide to write a hater comment and tell me how much I suck, listen to me, because I do have an actual point. It's not just 'cause I listen to her and I don't like her. I don't hate Taylor Swift as a person. Um, I think she's pretty. I think she should be a model; uh, she's tall and she's thin and she's gorgeous. Um, she seems like a nice person. I just really dislike her songs a lot. 
And let me tell you why, 'cause it's actually pretty funny. I don't know how many people have noticed this, but a lot of people who are kind of into music, I guess, or have a keen ear, doesn't even -- you don't even have to be into music -- can notice that people use the same pord -- pord progression -- chord progression in every song. And chord progressions are basically, um, the order in which you do the chords; you know, C, D, F minor; I don't know; name any four. 
Um, most notably, a band -- it's like, this is Nickelback, you know. If you listen to their songs closely, it's just dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun, in every song, basically, the way the chords go. Anyway, so to prove a point to my best friend Maria, who is absolutely obsessed with Taylor Swift, um, I transposed all of Taylor Swift's songs into the key of C, which basically means I've got all of her songs, all the chords; I put them so they sound -- they're in the same range, basically. And although the chords are different in the songs, when you put them in the same key, they are literally all the same. Literally, basically, almost the same. They use the same four chords in every song. This is Taylor Swift I'm talking about. They use C, G, A minor and F, in every song, if you put it in the same key. 
And to prove to you how similar they are, I'm just going to play all of her songs in succession so people can see what I'm talking about. 'Cause I'm not just stupid when I say that all of her songs sound the same. And not only musically do they sound the same. Lyrically, they are all about guys. They 're all about guys. I'm a teenager, with raging hormones; I'm a girl; I like cute, romantic movies, okay. I, whatever, fairytales -- Sleeping Beau -- I don't care, okay. I am not this boy crazy. Just throwing it out there. 
This is C, this is G, A minor, and F. Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting all we have to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby; just say yes. It's kind of off, but that's how the song goes, basically. I might get some of them wrong; I apologize. 
Here's a reason for the tear drops on my guitar. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star. Here's the songs that I sing and I don't know why I do. That's basically her two most popular songs right there. At least I know them. But there's more. If you can see that I'm the one that understands you, been here all along, so why can't you see you belong with me? You belong with me. 
So, yeah. 'Cause I can't -- I can't help it if you look like an angel. I can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain, so come feel this magic I been feeling since I met you, can't help it if there is no one else. And that's how the song goes. That's Hey Stephen, the same four chords. 
Now I'm going to use the same four chords, but it's going to be in a slightly different progression. It's going to be C, A minor, F, D. And when you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think my favorite song, the one we dance to all night long, and the moon like a spotlight on the lake, and when you think happiness, hope you think of my little black -- black dress, think of my head on your chest and this faded blue jeans. I think it goes that way. 
There's no tune and it goes exactly in this progression. I just wanted to slam your screen door, sneaking out late, tapping on your window. When you're on the phone and you talk real slow, 'cause it's late and your mama don't know. I'm not finishing that, because it would have required me to write down the lyrics and I didn't really feel like writing them, so one more. I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive; you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying; so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time; as far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn. 
And that's what's up. And that's why I hate Taylor Swift's songs.
