Hey guys, it's XXXX here and guess what? I'm back. Right, you're probably wondering why I haven't posted a ton of new videos. Well, I will tell you and let you in on a little secret. College is crazy. See, they pile on us a ton of work and expect you to have it all done. Don't they know I have YouTube videos to be making? I mean seriously, I have to have my priorities straight. Anyways, so this book is what's getting in the way, because I'm having to read history, huh, and to be honest, I wish history didn't exist. I hate reading about it. It's the most boring topic and I'm sorry if you guys like history, but I don't. But anyway, in other news, I got a new video camera about two days ago. Actually one day ago. I got it last night, I believe and, um, I love it. It works with my Mac and that was the biggest problem with my other video camera, so now I'm able to video tape on the go, which, you know, that's going to make my videos more interesting. So anyway, I promise you there is new content. I'm kind of working on more of the technical aspects at the moment. I'm trying to get new pictures made, new graphics; things like that. I know those aren't really that interesting, but I do want my profile to be a little bit more representative of me so anyway I guess, um, that's all. Expect new videos soon and you'd better write and subscribe and comment, all that crap, because I'm going to be expecting it. Much love guys. Bye.
