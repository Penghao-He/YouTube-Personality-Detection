Oh well, hey everyone. I am vlogging from inside of a car in Phoenix, Arizona, because I am there on a business trip. Pretty fun. Um, so this is kind of like an update video. All right, everyone sigh. All right, uh, we'll continue. I am sorry for not making a video in a while. I've been super busy. I bet the majority of you guys have as well, or maybe it's just me. I have -- I really -- I have a feeling that it's not just me, because school started this month, so if you're in college or returning to any type of schooling, um, the first month of September is always crazy. 
Especially for me. And I'm coaching soccer, too, which is great. If you follow me on Twitter, you'll know that I am very proud of my team. We're undefeated; it's under twelves. Uh, I love those kids. They watch my YouTube videos, too, so after, uh, practice, we'll go over how to do the gummy bear dance. It's really cute. We've done it a couple of times. 
Um, so thank you for everyone who sent in your questions. I have, um, a whole script written out. It's gonna be kinda different than maybe a normal question answer video. And I have a friend that's gonna be in it, so it's gonna be -- it's gonna be pretty fun. I'm filming -- I'm set to film that on Tuesday, so that's just really really exciting. I think you guys will enjoy it. 
Um, I have a few more videos coming out this month of October. We'll -- you'll see more of me than you did this -- that last month. I don't think I've ever not posted a video ever for like a whole month. Well, I mean, a while ago I had, but just for the month -- for the year of uh, o nine, hmm -- but I am in Phoenix and I've never been here before and it's -- as I look around -- like you guys can see what I'm seeing. 
All I can actually see is a wall right now. Yeah, just a wall, so that's just not probably the greatest view of Phoenix, but there is so much cactus everywhere. And like people don't have a lawn. Instead of having a lawn with grass, they have -- or I mean, they do have a lawn. Wait, what would it be called? A front yard? There you go. Instead of it being with grass, it's like dirt. That's the weirdest thing ever. 
I mean, there's probably going to be comments from people like, what, your front yard doesn't have dirt? And I'm gonna be like, no, it has grass. I'm from California. But then, there's probably gonna be other comments from people saying, I'm from California and I have a dirt front yard. I don't know, but it's just -- it's foreign to me. Okay, there you go, it's foreign to me. So there's cactuses everywhere, too. 
And it's -- the weather is surprisingly nice. Like I thought it would be just a little bit more -- I don't know, I just -- when I think of Arizona, I think of like, coyotes and cactus and desert, and hot air, not having water. And I definitely do not think or see -- think of what I'm seeing. There you go. 
I definitely do not think or see -- I'm sorry I'm all like thrown together right now. My thoughts -- this was just kind of a spur of a moment thing. 
So yeah, basically I'm in Arizona on a business trip. It's been really, really cool, seeing everything. This city is huge. Like, it's massive. I thought Modesto was a big city. Boy, was I wrong. This -- ceeway -- city and freeway together, ceeway. 
Oh, another thing. I have shirts coming out on District lines, pretty exciting. Um, I'm working with designs right now. I really hope you guys are gonna like them, because they're -- it's a little bit different, probably, than my last design, and it'll --it's for -- it's good for both, um, sexes, because there were some people that complained a little bit. They said that their shirts were too girly. And I'm -- I was trying to think, like, how can I make a strawberry shirt that isn't girly? 
Someone's calling me. I won't answer it, but uh. 
I don't know, how do you make a strawberry manly? I think -- when I think of strawberry, I think of -- I don't know, I don't know. I'm not gonna -- I'm not gonna say anything about that. 
But uh, future videos, I guess, just to say: there's the question answer one, there is a vlog in a you choose. I think you guys like that, when I give you guys the option of what my next video will be. And based off of that video, you'll see the result -- resulting video. And then I have a skit with me and my brother. That's gonna be really, really funny. Just me and David, because, uh, Christian moved to Sacramento. 
That's, uh, Burry family news for you guys. He's, uh, left the nest. Definitely didn't think he would be the first one to leave. I thought at least I would be the first one out of the house, but he's gone. We miss him. So um, that's about it. 
So yeah, I'm starting college, I'm in Arizona right now. Um, there will be more -- more videos in October. Oh, and I want to know, what are you guys gonna be for Halloween? I'm just -- I'm trying to figure out my costume, and in the blog TV, I said I was going to be Hermione Granger, but I'm maybe going to Disneyland for Halloween and I think -- I don't know. I want to be a Disney character, sorta. But I don't know what I would be or who I would be. So, I wanna know what you guys are gonna be and then, um, if you guys have any suggestions for who I should be, just go ahead and leave it in the comments, because I am just -- I just don't know. I don't know, and I don't want to look retarded either, so -- which -- yeah, anyways. So um, I'll see you guys later 'cause this is getting kind of long and I'll edit it up. Um, yes. Bye.
