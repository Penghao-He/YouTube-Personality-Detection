This is basically the best early birthday present I've ever received, and later on I'll give you a full view of the costume. 
Sorry about the weird, um, positioning of this camera. It's just that this is the only place with good, good, lighting and my camera's charging so it needs to be hooked up to the thing which is over there, and it can't be in the normal place; you get the idea. 
If you didn't know, I'm on school holidays and to start off the holidays me and my friend, Olivia, went to a four hour Hero concert, which was so awesome and we met the band, so here are some pictures now. 
This is making me look like I am a Goth, so I think I'll take this off, just for now. 
Me and my friend, Dylan, have been a massive fan of community channels videos for a very long time. So when she tweeted that she was going to be in Melbourne, we kind of had to react. Um, so we tweeted her, kept on asking where she was going to be. She finally said she would be in Chapel Street, in Fitzroy. 
So we went to Chapel Street, and we're searching for her for about two hours, just going up and down the street, and then finally, um, we saw her with her friend Sar , who was doing her FBI warning video, and they were both so nice to us. 
They, um, took us out for lunch, and it was such a good day, really nice people. She even mentioned me and Dylan in one of her videos, called XXXX. You can check it out on the sidebar, and if you're not subscribed to XXXX, I highly recommend you subscribe. 
St Kilda are number one on the ladder, which makes me so happy because we've been playing so well. 
Um, in fact, this week, I'm going to the footie with one of my friends, so that's going to be exciting, um, especially, 'cause I haven't seen him in a really long time. Yeah. 
In two days it's going to be my birthday, which is on a Friday, and I'm so excited because I'm gonna be getting a ukulele that I picked out from the music shop with my Mum. And it's such a lovely ukulele and I'm really excited, and yay! 
I have tickets to see All Time Low and Short Stack, so I'm very excited for that and hopefully soon, I'll be getting tickets to see Pink. 
Last week I went with my family and we saw Billy Elliot, and I got this t shirt. Billy Elliot, The Musical, by the way. And I have to say, it was really good, I really liked it, but it doesn't really compare to the movie. Um, I just think that the movie was brilliant and, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. 
One thing I particularly didn't like, was that Billy was, in the musical, he was really technical and he was so good, but I liked that part of the movie, how Billy wasn't technical and he was, kind of, just danced how he felt. Like, in the musical, he was doing, like, perfect developpes to second and, you know what I mean? 
It was Brendon Urie's birthday on April twelfth, as you may have known since I posted a video dedicated to him. And I found out the next day that he had a girlfriend, and grrr that makes me, just, quite jealous actually, because I love Brendon Urie a lot. 
As you may or may not know, I hate this particular girl called XXXX So I typed in on YouTube "hate XXXX" to see if anyone else had the same opinion as me. And this one guy did and he made an excellent video that you should check out in the sidebar. I just, I couldn't stop laughing for about half an hour. 
Before I leave you, I just want to say sorry for not posting a blog in a very long time, and I also want to say hello to Luellen's brother and sister, Tish and Lennon , hello. 
You so wish you had this costume.
