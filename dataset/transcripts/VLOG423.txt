Hi, I'm that girl who did vita for thirteen days and then quit. 
I realize that it's the second to last day, but now I figured I'd make a video. So sorry. I'm uncomfortable being in color. Or making a video during the day. So I'll guess I'll talk TV details; that's what I do most of the time. 
The season finale of Heroes was on on Monday night and it was okay. It didn't really feel like a finale. 
What else? K, I hope Filer will be back. Oh my God, spoilers, spoilers. I hope Filer will be back soon 'cause Sky rockets in flight, afternoon. 
Um, and then the hundredth episode of Lost is on tonight and I'm really excited about that. 
I don't think I've been like, looking at the camera this whole time. I'm wearing a shirt I borrowed from someone in like, eighth grade and I never gave back. Sorry. 
XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, try to make videos soon 'cause I want you to and it would make me happy. Happy. 
Yeah, so. I guess that's all I have to talk about and I don't know how to end a video, so mmm.
