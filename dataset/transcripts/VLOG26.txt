I know it's been a couple of weeks, but I've been really busy and I was just on vacation this last week, so I haven't really had the time. Um, but the other reason is because the past, like, two or three weeks before this week when I went on vacation, I actually wasn't doing that well. Um, which I was really scared to tell anybody because I have not done that in over a year. So, um, I was really ashamed of it, um, and I didn't, you know, do terrible or whatever, um, it's just since I started LA Weight Loss, which has been over a year now, I have not cheated on my diet at all. I have not eaten anything that I shouldn't. Um, and about three weeks ago, I don't know what happened, but, um, I started eating a lot of peanut butter and that basically became my addiction for a couple of weeks. I would come home from work and just kind of eat peanut butter out of the jar and I was -- I would think it's okay, but it wasn't, because I would keep eating it thinking, oh, you know, it's just an extra spoonful here and there, but I would end up eating, you know, a few extra tablespoons every day for like a week straight. Um, so really that was the basis of my like, bad weeks, was eating a lot of peanut butter and then I had one day that I ate too much. I had two extra bowls of cereal, I had an extra dairy, I had, um, I think an extra starch and maybe one more thing, but that might be it, um, and so it's not like I went way over board. I didn't like, you know, stuff myself, I just, um, ate too much that day and I haven't done that in over a year and I'm really ashamed of it, so, um. But I wanted to tell everyone because I'm obviously not perfect and, you know, I think it is okay to have bad days. It's just I haven't had one, so I'm not okay with myself doing that -- I don't allow myself that and, but I'm over it. I'm past it now because, um, this past week I was on vacation and I really wanted to like start again, like, you know, like, no more of that. 
So I'm on vacation and I had the most amazing time and I got to hang out with XXXX to which I will put his link in the sidebar, um, he's awesome and I had such a blast hanging out with him. Um, I also met XXXX, like, in Arizona, her link in the sidebar as well and ah, love her just as much. Oh my gosh, we had a blast which I will, hopefully -- be soon -- in the next week or two putting up a video of that footage of my vacation, but, um, had a great time and I didn't eat anything that I shouldn't. Um, I had frozen yogurt three times with XXXX, however, um, I didn't eat a lot in that day and we were walking a lot and we hiked and so I think it was completely okay. 
Um, so, but, ah, yeah -- and so before I left on my vacation I was about one ninety four something. I think on my last weigh in that I posted I was one ninety four point eight and that was about what I was. Um, because the last, you know, few weeks I was just maintaining between one ninety three and one ninety five, so when I left I was one ninety four point eight and, um, this morning when I got home I was one eighty nine which is awesome because, ah, I've never been in the one eighties and I -- it's a really good motivation for me to get right back into gear, and, you know, get this like, I want to be one sixty for my ultimate goal which is only, you know, thirty pounds away. That's not a lot. I can do that and I have new motivation. I have new, um, I feel a strength inside of me to really just do it, um, and that's my plan. So, my plan right now is just do it. I want to do it and, you know, I agree that, you know, it's not like it's a race, I don't have to get it done really fast, but I want to right now. I'm so motivated right now and I don't want it to go away, I just want to focus and do it and be at my goal and simple as that. So that's my new goal for the next, ah, I'm going to give myself, I think, four months -- well not give myself, but am hoping within four months -- at the end of four months I'll have lost, um, about thirty pounds and, ah, I think it's doable. And I have a friend that's gonna, you know, do it with me, so -- 'cause she has basically the exact same amount of weight to lose, so I'm really excited for it. Um, but now I want to tell you about my vacation. How awesome it was. 
I had an amazing time. I flew to Arizona with my mom -- where my grandparents live -- and I was there for a few days and then, um, after that we went to the Grand Canyon, and then after that we drove up and we went to Yellowstone -- oh, no, actually we went to Arches first , which is really cool and then we went to Yellowstone, and then we drove home. I live in Minnesota, so we kind of went up and to the right whatever, um, it was amazing and I did a great amount of exercise, which I will tell you right now. 
Right, so the first day I was there, I hiked up a small mountain with my grandpa which was amazing, um, it took him like, I don't know -- I was out hiking for an hour or two, I think like two hours and we had to climb up to the top except there was no path at the top, so we just had to climb up rocks and, you know, be very careful because they were like -- some of them were falling and there's cactuses, so I had to like dodge them and I got my hand poked a few times and it was an amazing feeling hiking up there and climbing down and hiking and just, you know, it was a great exercise. 
The very next day, the next morning actually at like five thirty in the morning I got up and I went for a twenty mile bike ride with my grandpa and his little community friend which was beautiful, but awesome and great exercise and then within an hour XXXX had picked me up and, um, we went to another mountain to go hike up, which, um -- unbelievable because that one it took us about three hours to do. It took us about two hours to get up to the top and then an hour to get down, approximately. Um, and it was amazing. I didn't think we could do it and we stopped a lot -- well, I had to stop a lot, he has incredible endurance -- I don't know. Telling me to stop a lot and we really should keep going, and we're just like we got to do, so we did it and it was beautiful and I can't believe we did it. We hiked up to the top of a very high mountain and it was amazing and uh, it was great and it was a great workout and, uh, I'm just so proud of myself and XXXX. 
Um, then the next day we didn't necessarily do like exercise, but we walked a lot. We walked to the grocery store, we walked around his campus, we walked to the mall, like, we did, you know, a decent amount of walking, so that was pretty good. 
And then the next day I was at the Grand Canyon, and I walked two and a half miles around the rim of the Grand Canyon which was also beautiful. And then the very next day, the next morning I hiked down a mile and a half into the Grand Canyon, which wasn't too difficult, but then I had to hike that mile and a half back up the canyon which was very difficult, very hot, very tough, very steep incline. Wow, very, very hard. 
Then the very next day we were at Arches and I hiked, I think it was, um, it was about two and a half miles just hiking around different trails, and up and down, you know, hills and what not and arches and getting to arches and what not, and so that was -- that was a good day 'cause it was very hot and it was tiring and I ran a little bit. It was great. 
Um, and then the next day when we were in Yellowstone. I did a little, little tiny bit of hiking, but not much. It was really cold and I was driving a lot that day, so I don't really count that, but, um, I was very active on vacation and it was amazing and I think that's why I lost about five pounds this vacation. So that was amazing. 
Um, but yeah, I will hopefully make another video, um, soon about my vacation what not, um, and yeah I -- I really hope that by next week I can hopefully maybe be down to one eighty seven. That's going to be my mini goal. I'm really motivated and I really want to do this, um, and I think I can, so, yeah. 
Hey everyone, I'm here and I'm finally making an update.
