Hello, it's me been in Vegas for about fifteen more days now, so I'm just basically going to show you the best thing I have worked out how to do. It sucks a bit, but I've worked out how to do it, I'm happy with that; so, here it goes. 
See, I just , wow that was the coolest thing I could do. Of course, there are a lot of other cool things I can do, like making it a bit more black and white now. See, and now giving it color back. So, learned how to do a couple of things, I might get , I don't know, there might be a better editing software. But I want to work out how to do green screen as well, because I can just go to the stationers and buy some green bits of card, that would be cool to do that kind of thing. 
So this is probably going to be my last video before Christmas, so hope everybody have a nice Christmas. Good luck to and XXXX for their videos. They have just started making videos. So basically that's what I've got for this video. 
Merry Christmas to everybody. I hope everybody liked my copyright video, it almost got the most amount of use from all of my videos, so thanks for watching that. Um, I'd just like to say a Merry Christmas as well to Greg, yep. Greg wishes everybody a Merry Christmas, so thank you for that little speech input from these fake audio speakers around here; so goodbye.
