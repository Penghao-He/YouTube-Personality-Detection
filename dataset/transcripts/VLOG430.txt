And as I look around the places I know, fell in love with the people in the front row. 
﻿Yay! Finally, argh, okay, um, I just recorded this vlog just a second ago, but it -- I don't know, the sound didn't work, or something, so that annoys the hell out of me. So now I've set up a, um, something to record my voice while I'm doing this, so I'll put that on later; cue the powers.

It's like a twelve year old game, it was like in the ninety six, I think it was, yeah, it's made for Windows ninety six, so I don't actually know how it was made. Um, I'll look it up on Wikipedia later, or you can. Um, I'll-- yeah, I'll put the link on the sidebar; that way I think it is, yeah, pretty sure, it's that way. Um, you know, everything is different on my screen, um, yeah. Croc is an awesome game and I've been addicted to it. My computer is the only one that works like, runs it, 'cause mine's like, old. Um, I'm not using my computer at the moment. Um, what else is there? Um, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, and I forgot what else I was going to say. Um, yeah. Stay cool, people. Go for the love. Love you so. Not really. But no, I do love you. Um, but yeah, see ya. Miss you, say goodbye.
