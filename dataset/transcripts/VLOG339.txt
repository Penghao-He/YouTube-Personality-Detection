Uh, hey good morning it's Warn's lake. How are you doing? 
Um, as many of you know uh, uh, a few weeks ago Bart the Fish, Canada's best loved political fish passed away. It was a very sad uh, time for -- for many thousands of Canadians and a lot of people wondered how can Bart ever be replaced. Well, Bart has been replaced. 
Um, uh, I don't know if any of you uh, are aware of the fact that I'm kind of into Star Trek. Um, episode forty four broadcasted in December of nineteen sixty seven written by David Gerrold, won many of awards. Uh, Rohant Assdy wrote a song about it uh, called the Trouble with Tribbles and uh, I -- I just wanted to show you here's a -- here's a tribble, can you hear him ? 
This is a real tribble. See, he's got the real Star Trek thing on it. Um, we call him Greg. So this is uh, Greg the Tribble and um, Greg is, uh, gotta pretty smart political brain. So for example here uh, just listen carefully. Uh, Dalton Agetti . He likes Dalton Agetti. 
Uh, uh, how about, um, um, how about Mike McManieth ? Ah, that's a nice Tribble. Okay um, okay, how about, oop, Steven Herper , George Bush? He -- he doesn't like them. Steven Harper, George Bush, wow. Greg the Tribble has and acute sense of political, um, smarts. 
Anyway um, so here you go. Here's Greg, yeah. Say hi to him you are going to get to know him quite a bit over the next little while and ah, have a great day from -- from me and Greg.
