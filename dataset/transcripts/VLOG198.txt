Hi guys. Um, I am making this video because we haven't caught up on a really long time and pretty much this is just like an update. We are not disappearing, we have not fallen off the face of the planet, we are here. We've just been really busy planning like moving, because we're moving to the city, so that's really exciting, in January. And so the whole point of this was because we got a Twitter. Twitter is easier to update then YouTube. Um, so you can follow us on Twitter. We are basically -- no -- why? We are -- we got city dreams and you can go to us there and we'll keep you pretty much updated about if we're doing a new video or just life in general. And, I have something else to say but I don't remember. I think we'll have a new video out sometime this week, isn't that exciting? Okay.
