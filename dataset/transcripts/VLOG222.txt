Hello. So guys, this is my hundred fifty first ever blog. The reason I'm telling you about my hundred fifty first blog is because I forgot that my last one was my hundred fiftieth. Somehow a hundred fifty seems like a more rounded, suitable number for a milestone than a hundred fifty one, but you're just going to have to deal with it 'cause, I forgot. 
So, yeah, hundred fifty first video, wanted to do something cool to celebrate, couldn't think of anything cool to do to celebrate. So what I'm going to do, I know a lot of people make awesome cakes and stuff; I'm just going to tell you a joke. 
It's my favorite joke in the whole world. Okay, here's my joke, I've actually said this joke in a blog before but I'm hoping that none of you remember, because if you do remember, I'm gonna feel kind of stupid for recycling my joke. 
Anyway, this is my absolute specialty of a joke, it is my uber cool, amazing, awesome, perfect joke that I'm building up really badly, and you're probably gonna be really disappointed. Two muffins are in an oven, one muffin says, "Cor, it's a bit hot in here, " and the other muffin says, "Aah, a talking muffin. "
Isn't that joke just amazing though? Because I think I first heard that joke when I was like, ten, and I remember thinking when I was ten, that is, you know, that is one hell of a joke, but in the last two days I have come across three people who don't understand that joke. 
Now, it's all fine when someone doesn't understand a joke, but when they analyze the joke, and pick apart the joke, and are like, this joke doesn't make sense, because this is this -- that really bugs me. It's like, you don't get it, just shut up about it. 
Not that I'm pointing fingers at anyone, Tom, seeing as you wanted a shout out. Here's your shout out, you ruined my joke, why'd you ruin my joke? I'm only joking, it was fine that you ruined my joke, I won't hold it against you. 
Can everyone, please, leave their favorite jokes in the comments? 'Cause, it will just be fun for me to read, and if there's any really good ones, I'll read them out in my next video. 
Anyway, what have I been doing lately? I've been watching X Factor lately which I don't even want to talk about because I'm just still too angry about it. 
And on Saturday I went on a school trip to see plays about sex trafficking, which was very, very, depressing because you kinda think that that sort of thing only happens in third world countries and really, like, undeveloped places, but there's fifty illegal sex trade places in Croydon alone, which in context is like, a small part of London. That was really, really, really hard hitting, and it made me think that we suck as a country. 
I'm gonna just say one more thing, because this is, like, really important. So, I -- I'm sure most of you know what Chartjackers is by now, but if you don't, basically, four UK bloggers. Alex, Charlie, Jimmy and Johnny were picked by the BBC and asked if they would write and produce and perform, using the YouTube community -- I'm just using my head instead of my hands, 'cause I'm holding my laptop on my knees. 
Um, the song that they were gonna release in the charts for Children in Need, which was done. And now all that needs to happen, is that everyone needs to buy the song so that we can raise loads, and loads, and loads and loads of money for Children in Need. 
So I'm going to put a link in the sidebar to the song which you can buy from iTunes and Children in Need own the song now, so every single penny goes to them. So it will be so good if you could buy the song, even if you hate the song, but you won't hate the song 'cause it's an amazing song. 
So yeah, I'm going to go now and I'm going to leave you with this thought. It's my eighteenth birthday on Thursday, the nineteenth November. 
Goodbye.
