Hello internet, I just can't concentrate on anything anymore. Here I am, I have a quick question and that question is do you know what the Project for Awesome is? If you don't go to this link and read about the Project for Awesome; if you do I can go right into the question I'm going to ask; what charities do you support? If you are not taking part in the Project for Awesome this year, I need to know what charities you guys think are most important. I already have a couple that I support, but I need one specific charity; not really picky about what it supports that I can do for the Project for Awesome this year. I was going to do one last year, and I was going to do Save Darfur, but I never got around to making the videos so I kind of, you know, just put it on hold, but this year I really, really, really want to do Project for Awesome so I need your input; what charities do you guys think are the most important? Leave me a comment; send me a video response or message and let me know what you guys think. 
I have two YouTube accounts so I might do two videos, we'll see what happens, but I need to know what you guys think and I'll compare your responses with what I already had in mind and we'll go from there. 
If my head looks a little bit weirder than normal, it's because I got a haircut and it's really short. It's a little bit shorter than I hoped and I've had a hat on all day; so it looks really weird, but I don't know I'm kind of getting used to it; that's the beard I guess. I don't know. For some reason my beard doesn't grow as well as Shay Carl's does. So I'm never going to have an awesome fuzzy, grizzly Adams beard; like Shay. 
What else happened, I went on a hunting trip with my dad. We saw about seven deer total, one small buck and six doe; including the one that ran out in front of us as we were driving home from the bar. I saw some Cougar tracks and we also had a verbal argument with a porcupine, which was kind of exciting. 
I also got Blu ray from Wal Mart, they had it priced at twenty bucks and it rang up as fifteen. It really surprised me because this one comes with the blu ray, the special features and this is where the regular DVD goes, people are actually watching it downstairs and it also comes with the digital copy. Let's see, it says there right there on the back. I was really, really excited to get this because on the special features they have footage from the Deathly Hollows. If you haven't bought it yet, I recommend doing so. If you guys don't already know I'm a hardcore Harry Potter fanatic and I was sitting here yesterday and I was watching the movie; I started to get really, really giddy and excited and when I watched the footage from the Deathly Hollows; and I kind of a did a little face palm because I realized I was trying to do what one of those Twilight fans would do and then I realized that Harry Potter is so much better than Twilight on every level imaginable; and I felt okay about it again. 
If you guys haven't checked out averagewizard. com, do so. It's really cool. It's kind of like that FMLs and the MLIA for Harry Potter fanatics; and there's a Twilight one as well, but I've been, you know, staying away from it because it's Twilight. I mean I enjoyed the books when I read them, but this whole fan base is just ridiculous. Harry Potter teaches to overcome adversity and keep your friends close and, you know, to treasure life. Twilight teaches pedophilia and bestiality. . 
Seven up is the best drink ever. I used to be obsessed with Sierra Mist and then I started drinking Seven Up again; and it's actually a little bit better for you. I mean it's still pop, soda, fizzy drink whatever you guys call it where you're from. It's not good for you at all in general, but over Sprite and Coke and Sierra Mist and Pepsi, this is actually better for you because it's all natural flavors; and there's really no additives other than corn syrup. So I really like Seven Up, but I'm trying to get off pop completely. 
I know I'm kind of late in the dedication to December, so I'll like start that on the fifteenth and just do half way through December and January. 
Oh, one more thing, this New Year's I'm going down to Pittsburg to spend that period of time with my guitarist, Kevin, and his wife Hilary and Kevin and I are going to be recording some tracks. If you guys haven't checked us out on MySpace, I'm going to put the link right here at the bottom. Be sure to check this out, add us, and listen to the tracks that Kevin has already laid down. None of my vocal tracks are up there just yet. I haven't had really a chance to record anything good; my house is always full of people and it's just, you know, hard to record anything here. So when I go down there we're going to get some recording done and we will have a studio EP within the coming months; so keep an ear out for us; add us on MySpace; we're going to have a YouTube where we're hopefully going to have some unplugged taped stuff. So who knows; and if you like it you do; and if you don't well tell us; tell us why you don't like it; maybe we can do something that suites your taste. 
Thanks for watching and I will see you guys later. Peace.
