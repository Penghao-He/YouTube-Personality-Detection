Hi YouTube. So, first off, it's been a while and I apologize for that and I didn't intend for it to happen. But alas, it did. After I made my first video I didn't really know what to put up next 'cause I had nothing to talk about. And I'd rather put out quality videos that I think people will enjoy rather than just turning out crap every week so there is something out there. So, I didn't make one for about three weeks or so. Then I had some friends who asked me if they could borrow my camera to film something for a scholarship and of course I was like Oh, yeah, higher education. Of course, it's a worthy cause. " So, I gave them my camera and then Marvin was gone for three weeks. So, I just got him back the other day and I'm so happy that he's here and everything just great. Moral of the story is never let your friends borrow your camera. 
Probably the biggest news I have for you is that on this past Sunday, ah, I went and saw Demitri Martin in Portland and XXXX and XXXX were there too and that was great. And he was as I expected, a very very funny man. And if you ever get the chance to go see him I would recommend doing so. But the best part of it was, after we left the show my friend Harry and I -- that's who I went with -- my buddy Harry. Ah, we were walking by the theater and noticed there were like twenty people outside these shifty looking doors and we wanted to know what was going on. So, we stood there and it was just this guy who was noticeably not Demitri Martin loading things from the store into this car with a driver. From the door to the car, it's a dance. We started looking at the stuff that he was loading in there and it was stuff like Demitri's keyboard, Demitri's guitar. So, I looked at Harry and we both got really excited. And then the guy came out and whispered something to the driver, who drove around the block really fast. So, we followed the driver to the other side of the theater. And then out comes Demitri Martin in all his shining glory and he's just like hey guys. Pictures ensued and people shook his hand and got his autograph. And the best part for me was he drew on my phone. Although nobody will believe that Demitri Martin drew on my phone, so I will be battling for that story this coming school year. 
I'd like to talk about something that I've noticed that I think is despicable. We all know that the elderly are not as acute as they once were. If you -- they don't remember things -- it's -- you know, it's just how it is. And sometimes they get a little bit confused. A good example of this is when my brother asked my grandma for Battlefield Two for Christmas and she got him Battlefront Two, which is okay 'cause they're both good games. It's an easy mistake to make. This is completely innocent. The games just happen to be titled similarly. But some companies have gone out of their way to make products that imitate other products to confuse grandmothers. A case in point, I was at the store the other day and at the end of the checkout counter where they always put the little weird toy things on sale, was a movie. Everybody's familiar with Pixar's Up -- there's a, whew, poster for it there. That's what Up looks like. And then this movie was called What's Up. And I'm not okay with that because the covers look similar, they're titled similarly. Who's to know what's the real product, if you're not really familiar with it. So, I've decided that is very bad and there should be laws against it. Get to work on it, Obama. 
It's just dawning on me that I actually haven't spoke about how the gathering went yet. Um -- it was phenomenal. I had loads of fun and I hope everybody else did too. And I just wanted to thank everybody who was there. There were more people than we could've ever anticipated. That was fantastic. Ah, we're planning for next year already and we'll get that information out as soon as we can to allow ample time for traveling preparations to be made because you want to be there. You want to be there. 
Okay, here's another gripe. I went in to get my school schedule yesterday and I noticed that there are a lot of classes on there that I didn't forecast for. And some of them are classes that I had completed freshman year, which I thought was strange. So, I went to the schedule changing station and I said what's up guys? And apparently three of the media classes that I had forecasted for did not exist. I'm just confused, why would they put them in the catalogue if they weren't real. They're like decoy classes. I'm not -- I don't know why they would try to trick me. But apparently what happened was not enough kids signed up for those classes, which was unfortunate because that was, like, half my schedule so I to get that whole mess reworked. But in the end it was fine and now I get to sleep in every other day because I have a first period open. 
And now to end on a sad note, one of my favorite YouTubers, Lamar, also known as Wilson Tech 1 has shut down everything internet related. And I have not been able to contact in any way. But if he still watches these videos, Lamar, this is for you. Good bye and best wishes. I hope that I'll get a job at Subway in Chicago and maybe I'll see you someday. 
All right. That's it. Bye.
