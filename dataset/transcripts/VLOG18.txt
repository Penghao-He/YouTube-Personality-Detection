So, there was a bit of a gathering on Tuesday that I attended. Look, 
I took this picture, which means that I met The Jonado. That's over the
-- conversation varied from the merits of presidential bodyguards to abandoned buildings in Detroit. So, yeah, that's how I met Lea -- sorry, Lea and David and Scott and Joe and Monica and Shelly and John and I'd like to give a final shout out before video completion. First of all, to the tag team duo of Brissy and Robert for making these awesome shirts and second of all, to Columbus Library Security for holding it down, because right before we went into the auditorium, there were these thirteen and fourteen year old girls sitting right outside the door. Just so you know, here's a layout of the hallway we were sitting in. 
Thank God, the security man came up to the girls and said, you girls make sure you don't block that elevator. Thank you, sir, for making the world a safer place to live in. 
So quick recap. I went to a gathering this week, which means I met XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX . The last three, I kind of met by chance. 
Back it up. So the gathering happened. Copters, copters. I asked this guy about XXXX. Do you know where XXXX is, at all? Friendly. XXXX talked. 
As you know, there's a tradition if you win the Nobel Prize, you give it all the charity, but no. 
We got stuffed signed. And then me and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX were standing outside the library, near the short sisters, XXXX and XXXX. That was when XXXX walked up and saw us standing near XXXX and XXXX. I guess he figured we were with them. And he asked, so where are we going? So the group walked to a nearby restaurant.
