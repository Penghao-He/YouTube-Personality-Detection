And now I am back home. And as you can tell, I went to go see Toy Story One and Two in three D. These are my three D specs. Do you like 'em? I like 'em. Do you like 'em? I don't care if you like 'em 'cause I like 'em. I had a good day; it was good. It was hot. Go see Toy Story One and Two in three D. It's awesome, totally worth it. It's really good. Hope you guys have a great day or did have a great day. Ta ta till tomorrow. 
Well, hey there, everyone. It is a beautiful day in Richmond, Virginia. And for the beginning of October, I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be eighty five degrees. But the upside to it is, I got Subways so I'm going to eat, have a good meal, let this bus pass 'cause it's really loud. But going into the Comic Bookstore. Go on into the Comic Bookstore. It's going to be good times. I'm excited to read my comics and this is Broad Street, loud as hell. Yeah. Broad Street. Thanks for being loud and not letting me blog. Douche bags. 
Here I am at the CT, which is basically the Virginia Commonwealth University newspaper. Where, apparently, me being a blogger, is enough to get me a piece for the website, or something like that? I don't know. I got a call from that chick right there, and she was like, "Sid, you know, we need a blogger to talk about information about the Internet. " And I said, "Yeah, I would love to, 'cause I'm an Internet sensation. " And, uh, I -- I agreed to it. So, I'll let you guys know where to go. It's probably going to be ct. com or something? What is it? CT? commonwealthtimes. com, so go there. Probably starting next week I'm going to be doing blogs for these people. I'm excited, so, yay!
