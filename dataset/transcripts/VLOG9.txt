Hey guys, it's Monday. Have you ever recorded an entire video only to discover that for some reason or another you don't have the footage that you just took? Well, that just happened to me and I can tell you that it is like the most frustrating feeling in the world. Actually, probably not, but it's really frustrating. Yeah. It makes me really angry. I don't even want to think about how long it has been since we have posted a video on this channel, but I am very happy to be back and I should be looking at the square. I'm looking at the square. 
So I hope you had a good first day or first week of school. I started school today. I'm usually excited for it to start but this -- this year, I just felt like this summer went by so fast. English, history and drama should be okay. English is my favorite subject so it's really hard for me to dislike my English class. And I'm taking French two, Chemistry, Study Hall, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah -- help. It's boring. So that is that. The information we got in English class says, you cannot hide in this class. Ha, ha, ha. Summer reading -- we had to read three books. We read The Devil in the White City, which was sort of not a political but like a, um, murder mystery type biography ish historical thing. I told you before I suck at book summer reads. People are like what's the book about and I'm like, nuh -- especially explaining stuff like Harry Potter. I just always sound so stupid. The Color Purple Witch I actually enjoyed a lot. The Sun Also Rises, which all I have to say about this book, is that it's awful. And if you have a choice, don't read it. Oh, do you want to see something really scary? Monstrous Elements of a Literature book. And it's huge. And gigantaur . Blah. 
Oh. Here's a picture of me and a giant lizard of the zoo. Stop shaking. Stop. Mmhhmm. So I've talked about school and the first day first, so I could, like, have the second part of this video be actually happy and talk about summer. 
I had a really great summer. It was too short because, um, the only part of the summer that I actually enjoyed was July because June was like super boring, because I was just stuck here. I went to Fairhope to visit my grandmother for the fourth of July and then I drove back with Katie to Montgomery. For two weeks, I was a counselor at Camp Shakespeare. I've been a counselor for three years now. Um, I was a camper for four. This is the first year that I've actually bonded with, um, all the other counselors and I miss it a lot, and we did not get to spend enough time together. Between being a counselor and then going to the teen camp, I made a bunch of new friends as well as, um, getting to spend time with the friends I already had, who I love. And I miss everyone so much. And next summer, I hope I can be with you guys even longer. 
Teen camp was great. It was a week and we did Othello, and one of the first things that our acting teaching said to us was, you may notice that there are no African American children here. So, it will be a learning experience. And it was. We had some girls playing Othello because it was all split up so, there were like several of each character so everyone had a chance because there were a lot of people. But we had girls playing Othello. I was one of the Cassios, so I didn't really like bitchy, yeah, like I was one of the Cassios, yeah. Yes. My summer was very good and I am sad that I am back and going to school. Pppffff, it's kind of a bummer. 
This has been a boring blog and I'm sorry, but I am glad that the pseudo Canadians are back. I don't have any questions to answer, because we haven't been doing this project for a while and we're just sort of starting afresh. But Russell, I would like to know some of the stuff you said in your thing that you did over the summer, okay? The American Dream definition because that's what our English class this year is going to be about. It's American lit so it's going to be about the, um, American experience, our teacher said. I keep fooling with my hair 'cause I remember that you posted up all this and that was like ha, ha, my definition is really sarcastic, and then you put that quote by George Carlin that says, it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. So yes, please summarize or read part of what you said 'cause I would like to know it. 
My question for you guys is what was your favorite part of this summer? Um yeah, so that's about it. Tell me your favorite part of the summer and put stuff on your head.
