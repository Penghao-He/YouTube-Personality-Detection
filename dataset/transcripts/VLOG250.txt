Hello, faculty of Business and Law, especially Milanese's Law School crew. My name is, uh, XXXX, and this video is here like, is my audition of the Uni, your voice video. Now, a little bit about myself. I'm third year Leeds math student studying law, and it's going pretty well, you know, in typical student style, you know. The work is piling up to about what, this high? No, I'm exaggerating. But, um, yeah, it's getting tough. So -- really important year, so I'm just trying my best, just doing the best that I can. But also, I do other things, both on the law side and on the business side as well, which is quite interesting. 
Um, first of all, um, I've been doing since the first year Street Law, and uh, if you're wondering what Street Law is, it's basically a group of us go around to many different colleges, different schools, and even did my first for the University itself, and doing presentations on certain legal topics that might affect that particular group. My last presentation was in Roundhay School, and we did one on Worker's Awareness; and that was in my second year. And it was pretty good, you know. The kids were fine; they didn't misbehave or anything. And that school it's actually quite -- pretty big. It actually reminds me of Heatonly . So, yeah. 
And, um, secondly, I'm also doing Business Data Workshop. I'm not presenting it, I'm actually attending it. some tips on how maybe being self employed could be a potential career option and I'm seriously considering it. It sounds very exciting, yet very risky, so that's going good. I think the next one is actually today, at two o'clock. I think it's about, ironically enough, legal issues so that would be quite interesting. 
And also on the business side, I'm also part of a team in the IBM University Business Challenge. Which is basically a nationwide challenge, throughout many, like, a good couple hundred -- maybe on three hundred -- universities competing and doing business simulations. I have certain ideas about we're, like, consultants trying to run a business. And it's going pretty good. Um, we just had the photo shoot, think the other day, think few days ago. And, um, something quite funny happened. I'm not going to go into detail on that, but let's just say someone didn't actually come in properly dressed. That's all I'm going to say for that. I don't want to embarrass the person in question. 
So, um, in my spare time, I actually, funny enough, do things like this. You know, if you check me, I'm also known on YouTube as XXXX, and on YouTube I just do various different blogs and reports. I do an extract of , I might put some stuff on annotations and stuff, so you can see it. But, um, yeah; that's what I do in my spare time. 
And why do I want to be part of this faculty video? Well, first of all it seems like a lot of fun. I mean, now I do this just in my room on my own. It would be good to take up a notch, maybe do something that's part of the university and maybe interview, maybe outside the Rose Bowl, in the main square. That would be pretty fun. And maybe for my own personal YouTube videos; I dunno. It's also a potential, maybe, job or career option, uh, being , 'cause it's some kind of job, you know. The key thing for me in life is to look forward to Monday mornings. You know, be out there, be like yes, Monday, time for work. And it's -- it's a big dream; don't get me wrong, but it's a dream none the less. 
So that's the -- that's the main thing I wanna say. Hopefully it's not too long. But I'm hoping I'm not too late. I know this e mail came out a few weeks back, so I hope I'm too late. I've just been busy; I didn't get around to doing this now, so hopefully that master class will help me build my confidence up at well, 'cause people say I'm quite quiet, and people don't see me talk and do out -- outish things and stuff. So hopefully I'll get through. So, I'll see you guys soon and, uh,
