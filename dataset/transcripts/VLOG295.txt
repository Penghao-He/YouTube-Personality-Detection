For those of you watching XXXX for the first time, welcome. I'm XXXX, your host. I have been making these XXXX for three years now. That's the same amount of time that I have been living in Japan and probably the same amount of time, I would say, that I have been studying that Japanese language. A little bit before I came to Japan I studied too, but I just round it out to three years. If you're watching this and it's your very first video that you have ever watched on my channel, awesome, great. For those of you who have followed my channel for a long time I'm sorry, but this is probably going to be a boring video. And say a lot of things that you've already heard many times before, okay? But what this video is here for is to condense answers for many, many of the same questions I get over and over again that I have answered before or, number two, are private things that I'm just never going to answer. One main thing that I ask is before you send any question please scroll through my videos, I have them listed in order, and with every video I've listed the topic that I covered on the FAQ. If you see the topic go ahead and check it out and see if I cover what you are about to ask. If I do not cover the aspect that you wanted, please tell me the video number that you've referenced and what aspect you want and I'll be happy to send you an e mail explaining more if need be. Otherwise, please watch this video first and then check out all the topics in my other ones before you think about sending a question. Otherwise, you're -- you are going to get referenced to this video again or I'll just never answer your question. Thanks for watching. 
Let's start with that number one question I get. Number one and that is Scott, what jobs can I get in Japan? A lot of people ask me this again, again, and again. What jobs can I get in Japan. Well, that's definitely a sign that you haven't watched any of my videos because in twenty to about thirty of my videos over the length of about a hundred videos, I've said again and again that teaching English is the only job that you can get unless you speak fluent or native level Japanese. Unless you speak fluent Japanese or have a spouse visa, that means you are married to a Japanese person and are staying in Japan under a spouse visa. There's some people that are in the military, that's a totally different story. Okay they have come over with the military, I'm not including that, okay? And then there are some people who are civilians in Japan who work for the military and that's a totally different story too, okay? You're still coming over with the military in my opinion. For those of you who have no connection to the military and are just trying to get over here and get a job, unless you speak fluent, and I mean native level Japanese, you are not going to get any other job than teaching English. Please do not send me an e mail asking how can I be a construction worker in Japan, how can I be a scientist in Japan, can I be a doctor in Japan. No! 
Number one, you need a four year degree or the equivalent to a bachelor's degree in anything, it can be anything, to teach English here in Japan. This will allow you to get past emigration and get approved for a work visa. And then you send all your information in to emigration and then they approve you for the work visa. In my first video I stated that you couldn't switch from a tourist visa, but Tokyo Sam uh, updated me on that and said that yes it is possible, I did it. So you can come over here on a tourist visa, search for a job and get approved. It is possible. 
The other rule is a spouse visa. You can come over here on a spouse visa, which you can stay on permanently, okay? You don't need to switch to a work visa, but you can also land a job that way as well. Uh, some people I have even seen forego having a four year degree and get a job with a spouse visa. So that's the other exception. Sometimes people even get other jobs but they're on a spouse visa. They're not on a work visa. Other than that, there is no other job that you can get, okay? 
Some people have asked me, Scott can I teach my native language which is Spanish, French, et cetera, et cetera. Yes, okay? There are jobs like that here in Japan where people do teach languages outside of the English realm, okay? Obviously Japan is an educated place; they want to learn more that just one other language. Um, so yes you can get a job doing that. They're not as common as teaching English but they do exist and you can get approved for a work visa on those languages. But unless you speak native or fluent level Japanese, there is no other job you can get other than teaching language. Nothing, nothing. 
You can get a little extra work in the food service area or a bar, okay? Some are oriented towards gagin of have a gagin theme so they hire gagin, okay? But those people do not get work visas and Japan will not approve a work visa for working at one of those places. 
Now there is exceptions to the rule, okay, but they are very few and far between. I could probably count them one hand. For instance, in Tokyo there are hotels that have an entire industry built around gagin who come over here for business trips. And their entire staff is gagin and they are on, uh, special visas but those people have worked really hard to get those jobs and they are an exception to the rule, okay? Don't ask me about how to get those. I've never worked in that business here in Japan. I have no idea. I'm cannot connect you with that. 
Now some people do come over here as just English teachers and work their way up to different jobs. They start to learn the language. They start to get networking. They start to get connections outside of that realm and they move into other things, great. If you have any doubt, Google it. That's always the best information that I can give you. 
What companies hire overseas? I don't know anymore. It used to me Nova. I've heard of oth -- Kiawas , which is an English conversation school that hire overseas, but a lot has changed since the economy has bombed. And it's not as common to get hired overseas. If it does happen, you will know in your country. I don't know here in Japan, okay? No company comes to me and says, hey Scott let your viewers know that we are now hiring overseas. If they do it you will have to Google it, you will have to research it, you will have to find out that information yourself. 
As for the JET Programme I have never worked in the JET Programme, um, from what I hear it is the cream of the crop. They treat you really well. You have to contact your Japanese embassy to learn about it. If you want to know more about the JET Programme, I suggest contacting somebody who's actually worked in it like Myargonauts, another J blogger, and possibly he can give you a lot of information on him. But, uh, you know, he might be bombed with a lot of e mails too, so don't always expect a response. 
And even though I do work as an English teacher here in Japan, I don't have any connections for you, okay? Please do not write to me asking if I can get you a job in Japan. Please do not ask me if I have any networking abilities that can land you a job, if I can get you an interview or if I can hook you up with the board of education in my area. No, no, and no. Okay? 
Finally, the most basic breakdown for getting an English teaching job in Japan. Step one, look for a company. Some hire overseas, but it's rare. Most hire directly within Japan. So your first step is probably going to be coming to Japan or finding that company that hires overseas. 
Step two, go for an interview, all right? Send your resume. They'll send you an e mail or contact you letting you know they want an interview with you. Go ahead and prepare for that. All the same rules apply just like any interview. Dress very professionally. Use professional language. 
Some are going to require you to teach a sample lesson. In that case be ready to teach for the age group that you would possibly teaching for the job. Some are for kids. Some are for adults. It all depends. It will vary with the job that you have applied for. 
Part three, if you are accepted, if you are accepted the company will most likely sponsor you a work visa. You must work a certain amount of hours to get a work visa. As of right now, I am unsure as the total hours that you need in which to get a work visa. I believe it's twenty eight or more hours, but I could be wrong so don't hold me to --
