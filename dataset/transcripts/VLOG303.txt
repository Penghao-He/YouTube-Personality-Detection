Everyone what's up? Uh, I haven't made a video in about a month or so. My alien rap was the last video I made and I just figure, you know, I just figure I'd update you guys with a quick little video blog off my webcam. Um, I don't know if you can see it. It's a pretty good webcam. 
Uh, it's Jordan . That's pretty trippy. 
But anyways um, I got a bunch of new editing software, my cameras working really well and uh, I got a bunch of new idea for you guys so I just wanted to tell you about them. 
Um, that's about it. I just wanted to tell you guys what's going on. Add me on MSN messenger. It's XXXX com or video chat with anybody. 
Um, that's about it. All right? Oh yeah, follow me on Twitter, too. That's what I was going to say -- twitter dot com slash mad XXXX, XXXX, it's all lowercased. 
All right, peace until next time, bye.
