Yeah, as implied, I'm now officially one year old, on YouTube anyway -- I'm thirteen in real life. Um, and I just wanted to say that it's really weird. Not really. But, it's kinda of cool to know that I'm, in a sense, a kind of veteran and I know how things work on YouTube. Not really, but -- 'cause I've only made eleven videos, but it's -- it's kinda cool -- one year. Yay. By the way, in case you haven't noticed, this video is -- in my opinion anyway - significantly better from the other videos, partially because of my wonderful new lamp light. Okay, this might -- this is gonna take a little bit of effort. All right. Random book shelf, I know. Yeah, it's wonderful, OAR poster, but that lamp -- and it totally lights up this room great, instead of my mini desk lamp, um, and I like it. But I don't know where it's from; don't ask me. Um, but I really -- woah, sorry -- like the lamp and I hope that it will -- Jesus, sorry -- stick around for -- at least for a couple more videos. Um, yay lamp. 
Yeah. I'm making this video for a total of three reasons -- two -- three? We'll see. Three. I'm gonna go with three, three for now. Three reasons. One, because it's summer. But, with summer, comes, as all children -- high schoolers -- kids know, summer work. And this year, instead of just getting to read whatever I want, which is -- by the way, now totally seems great -- um, I actually have required reading. And I have --yeah. And I have three books. One, two, three. Three -- three books. I have the wonderful -- one second -- A Distant Mirror by Barbra W. Tuchman, which I am currently not even close to half way, which is how much I have to read. Um, I would recommend this book if you are either a) a historian, or b) a social studies teacher. Otherwise, I'd pretty much steer clear of it. It's quite hefty; I don't know it's weight in pounds. Um, but it's quite big, and I don't carry it around with me. I read it here at my desk. Um, and it -- it's -- it's interesting. It's really in depth, like I really have a lot of facts that I didn't know, and now I do. 
Book two, How to read Literature Like a Professor by Thomas C. Foster. This book, significantly better. Um, in all seriousness, it's actually really interesting. Um, I am going into an advanced, uh, English and Social Studies course, so hence reading literature like a professor. And, um, he makes it really, really interesting, and teaching me about symbols, and -- and everything that you need to know when you're reading a book, and I actually have literally chuckled and laughed at how witty and humorous the -- some sides of his are. Like, for instance, he talks about Shakespearian quotes, and he just has all of these random, like, quotes, and I actually chuckled when I read one. I don't know what play this is from; if somebody could help me out with what play this is, by the way, drop a comment. Um, "Exit "-- let me see if I can get this -- "Exit, pursued by a bear. " And I literally stopped and I started chuckling almost, um, because I just thought that that's kind of funny. I mean --
Book number three, The Once and Future King by T. H. White. Quite, um -- quite hefty. I mean, it's six hundred pages of solid reading. Um, I'm actually enjoying this. I'm on page -- what am I on? I'm somewhere around page a hundred and seventy -- a hundred seventy or so. And, I enjoy it. I mean, I -- I don't like King Arthur. I don't like Arthurian fantasy. But, I like fantasy. Um, I have -- I don't -- let me just grab this. Um, I have multiple, like, Dragonlance, and I don't know how many people know Dragonlance. Dragonlance -- box sets -- this is one of the three that I have, and I like fantasy and this is kind of along the lines of that, and it's really good. So, I'm enjoying that. Um, yeah. 
Reason two, I wanted to talk about music. You know, music, like, the kind you listen to on your iPod, um, in the bus and the car on the train on a plane. Um, because I haven't really expressed how much I like music on TV . Now, I know some of you are going to be, like, totally W. T and his bands, but, um, I just want to say I just want to give you guys an idea of what music, like, I listen to, or enjoy listening to. 
And you guys know, um, with the State Radio poster on the wall -- walk past the office counter. poster on the wall and on the wall. I'm kind of a college conference I'm -- I'm sorry. Okay. College Rock. Kind of advocate, fan. Um, I like Dave Matthews' band a lot. Um, I'm not even going to get into how much I like Dave Matthews' band, actually. Um, I also like a band -- I'm going to snatch this. You've seen this before, trust me. I'm and this is the set list -- the original set list from, um -- um, April fifth -- April fifth ? April fifth two thousand and nine, the acoustic show? Yeah. All right. They handed it to me off the stage, along with the pics, which I keep right up on the top of my desk with the set list. 
Um, and also, like, this band -- not many people have heard of this band -- totally, um -- what's? Recommend. Sorry. Recommend this band, Gomez. Great band, um; how do I describe it? Blues -- India Rock -- Grunge. That's kind of the way to describe it. Um, I wanna see them -- I didn't get a chance to see them when they came to Terminal Five in New York, uh, a couple months ago. Um, I'm -- I just gotten in the -- well, I didn't just get in to them. Uh, I kinda been -- my dad interested in them. My dad -- the Dead Head -- My dad. My dad. If you've read about them on my blog, you know a little bit about my dad. Um, he introduced me to Gomez. I actually knew the words to some of the songs before I even knew the titles. It's the same thing with Dead songs; like, I know the words -- I knew -- I knew the words Samson and Delilah before I actually heard Samson and Delilah by the Dead. -- or, them playing it, anyway. And, um, I like Gomez a lot. Um, I've listened, probably, to the song "Hangover" -- "Be my --" like, five times today. Um, so, check your Gomez. And check out ; check out State Radio; check out . Um, I didn't think I said. Um, yeah. Obviously, you know what Dave Matthews band does. I'm not gonna play any of Dave Matthews band, because of copyright. Ooh. 
And, drum roll, please. . Reason three, I wanted to throw the idea up in the air to regular viewers, all six of you. Um, I wanted to do a little action. Whatever. I'll finish this in five minutes. I wanted to make a live show. I wanted to do a TV cable live broadcast, and I wanted to go on Blog TV. I know I'm talking really fast, but just stick with me and you can probably understand what I'm saying. I want to go on Blog TV and I wanted to do a live show. I thought it would be a lot of fun, and I wanted to know if you guys would watch, if you guys would advertise for it, if you guys would invite friends to come to the chat room and talk about stuff with me. Um, I might even have a contest or two; I don't know. Um, comment. Comments, comments, comments. Um, because I really wanna -- I really want some feedback on this, and I really would like to do this idea, but I don't know how many people would watch it, or how many people would actually benefit from me doing this. So, um, try to comment, because I really appreciate it, and I really want to do this. So let me know if you like the idea, if you have any recommendations, any sort a thing; I'm flexible. But the broadcast would probably be on a Friday or Saturday night, because I have a life. Kind of. That's all for now. I'm also running out of tape and I literally have one minute of tape left because I just used something -- I found something out for somebody else. Um, so, that did it. This is that blogger kid signing off. Okay, thanks. Bye. 
Hi. It's XXXX, and I'm one years old. Year. One year.
