All right YouTube people. I am making another video because I am like crazy about this new -- well she's not even new -- I think she's been here since like I don't know, two thousand and six whatever. Anyways Moesha Bean. It's my shout out to her. Okay. This girl. Yes. This is her page and everything on YouTube just in case you want to check it out and BB films, subscribe, everything. I'm trying to look for her -- you know -- her link. Where is that link at? I can't exactly find it. Oh I know. It's right here. Can you read that? No you can't. Okay. Well anyways when I put the video up here I 'm gonna put her name inside the tag links. But okay. 
This girl makes the most amazing films ever. They're short films of course but they're good. Okay. And she is inspiring and if you're like one of my friends, if you're in my group, you know I want to be a movie director. Yeah. She definitely gives me hope. Okay. I mean a black woman making these good films. She makes some good films. And even to the people that aren't my friends, this is a shout out to her. 
I suggest you all go check out her videos because they are really, really good. I'm serious. Like once that girl comes out with an actual full length movie in theaters and everything, I'll be the first one to have a ticket to go see the screening. You know what I'm saying? Like the premier and everything, that'll be me because her movies are good. They're interesting. They're not boring. And she acts in them too. She acts in her own films which isn't bad because she's not a bad actress. So definitely repping her, shout out to her and promoting her. Y'all need to go check her out. Okay? It's awesome. Later.
