Hi, I was watching the video about Brittany Murphy, and I understand I was in shock when I found out she died. Not so much that Brittany Murphy herself died, but more that she died young. Like, Karen Carpenter, you know, in cardiac arrest, very young. Something that could have easily been preventable. It makes me think about what am I going to do with my life? Um, how much more time do I have to live? What about people who are in Iraq, dying of preventable diseases like AIDS, swine flu, stuff like that. Brittany Murphy, at least is seems, lived a full life despite that she died so young, and it makes me think what are we going to do when we die? I want you to listen to this clip I got from CMT; and after I speak on it tell me what you think. In case you don't recognize the song, it's Tim McGraw's Live Like You Were Dying. Listen carefully. 
I was in my early forties, 
With a lot of life before me, 
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime. 
I spent most of the next days, 
Looking at the x rays, 
And talking about the options and talking about sweet time. 
I asked him when it sank in, 
That this might really be the real end? 
How's it hit you when you get that kind of news? 
Man whatcha do? 
I went sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing, 
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu. 
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter, 
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying. 
Some day, I hope you get the chance, 
To live like you were dying. 
He said I was finally the husband, 
That most the time I wasn't. 
And I became a friend a friend would like to have. 
And all of a sudden going fishing, 
Wasn't such an imposition, 
And I went three times that year I lost my Dad. 
Well, I finally read the Good Book, 
And I took a good long hard look, 
At what I'd do if I could do it all again, 
I went sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing, 
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu. 
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter, 
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying. 
Someday, I hope you get the chance, 
To live like you were dying. 
Like tomorrow was a gift, 
And you got eternity, 
To think about what you'd do with it. 
And what did you do with it? 
And what can I do with it? 
And what would I do with it? 
Sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing, 
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu. 
And then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter, 
And I watched Blue Eagle as it was flying. 
Some day, I hope you get the chance, 
To live like you were dying. 
To live like you were dying. 
To live like you were dying. 
As I think about that song, you know, this guy was in his forties and he was dying of cancer. I know someone that lost her mother at the age of fifty from cancer and it makes me think. This really makes me think. By the way, I'll bet, oh, sorry. There we go, we got that paused, I'm sorry I was on CMT so it could take off, I didn't realize I didn't have a pause but again, that song makes me think. You know, what are we going to do? We think we have forever and yet we do not. Life is finite. Think about all the people that have, that you've lost in a year, whether it be a friend in Iraq or whether it be somebody's mother died of AIDS, somebody's father died of cancer, and for that, for Tim McGraw, I'll bet that song is very personal. I do not believe he wrote it. I don't think that, um, he writes most of his songs, but, but I'll bet you all didn't know he lost his father the year before. Nonetheless, it is a very personal song, and if you really listen to it, doesn't it make you think? I'm sure Brittany Murphy, too, thought that she was going to live forever. I'm sure all of us think, but now, after seeing her death, you know, just reminds us -- shouldn't we treat every day as if that day were our last? Thank God for that reminder. 
Rest in peace, Brittany.
