I know I look like a total freak right now. I mean, this is how I usually look. Usually, I'm XXXX. And makeup less and this, this is what I sleep in to keep my hair off my face -- so don't judge me, all right? Apshhh. Okay, so basically I just wanted to say, I am not a fan girl. Do I look like a fan girl? Oh fuck! Aah, yeah, no. So, I just wanted to say, I'm sorry for frightening you, 'cause I know I did. I know you've got like forty people asking you all the same questions every single day. So, I'm sorry; don't freak out. All I wanted was somebody to show me around London, because I've never been there before. And it's a little frightening being somewhere completely far away from where I live. So that's it, okay? I didn't realize how stupid this looked till just now. Ah, now -- now I just look like a greasy peacock.
