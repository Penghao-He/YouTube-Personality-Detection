Hello, boys and girls and children of all ages. I think I did that wrong. Anyway to the point of the video, before I get this whole thing started explaining everything song so forth like I said on my last video, no matter, video before last. I just really want to say one thing. I should really start living up to what I say and not just what I do, no way. 
What I said in a few videos, don't care about your appearance, don't try to worry too much, I should try to live up to that. So, I'm going to let you all see my curly hair as it is normal, because I figure I might as well before I have it all cut off. I'll get to that here in a minute. So anyway, like I said in my sick blog, I have a few things to say. One, I was sick, so I can't -- I really could not, could not get up and do a blog like I would like to. Second, I have a plan. I'm going to grow my beard out for the New Year. I'm going to let it grow out every day; I should have recorded it yesterday, but I was, buh. So, I'm going to let it grow out now. It's growing out as of now, you can't tell because it takes time and anyways it will take -- point is I'm letting this grow out. I'm going to grow a full grown beard, so on, so long, so forth, weh. I'm messing up because I'm still out of it. 
Maybe it's the medication that's doing this to me. I had an idea pop in my head, yesterday, ow that hurts. I had an idea pop into my head yesterday, about what I can do to kind of help out with some new YouTubers who are just getting started. Like, um, I forgot his name -- Three sixteen Maloonics . I believe that's your all's name. I don't know how many owns this account, but I believe they're a partner, I can't tell. You said, you wanted me to give you a shout out, um, the thing is I don't give shout outs to many people, um, depending on who they are and if I know them since I've come here to YouTube. I know quite a few people since I've been here on YouTube, so they des -- ser -- ah --deserve a few shout outs, which I'm going to start doing here soon. 
See, this account was a XXXX account a while back, so I have a lot of people who enjoy XXXX on this account. So I'll give them a few shout outs to YouTube users who are below my subscription. Not below, I'm sorry, I'm off of it a bit today, who have less subscribers than me. I'm going to give them shout outs, because I believe they deserve it, well the ones I have subscribed to. So I'll start doing that I believe on every Friday, I'll just look around and take ten new videos, take about fifteen minutes of my time if it lasts that long every video, and I will probably, depending on those videos, I will give them a shout out. But now, I'm not giving shout outs to anyone who has over my sus -- over more subscribers than me, because they are already known apparently. Unless of course they have friend bops or add bops or just make bank accounts and just add themselves. I don't know how it goes. I'm not used to this whole cheating or hacking thing. 
I am used to purple combs, though. I go through these, what a month. I believe I said that I do one video, that's probably it. I'm going to start doing that and plus, as you can tell, it's -- I'm already looking rather odd with this. Well, technically I don't look odd as of yet, because if you all remember I had a goatee a while back and that goatee was annoying, and that goatee went away as soon as I had my hair kept. Along with this beard, I'll have a better haircut I hope and I hope I'll be able to straighten it. See, I don't like my hair curly for some reason. I can't stand it. It's something wrong with me. I have something mentally wrong with me, I'm trying to think what, gerbert, gerbert, gerbert, gerbert, but it doesn't come to mind and I can't think of the word I'm looking for, moron, moron, moron, moron, but that, I think, that's probably it and, um, I'm hoping I can start doing more interesting things that, um, would not be, um, boring, I guess, so some of you all, and I hope to get noticed more, um, what I'm trying to do is think of a video that people may like and they may watch and so forth and therefore it will get views and therefore I will get ratings and therefore I will be a idiot, but either way I'm trying to get out there, I'm at least trying in my own sense and my own style, apparently. I can't seem to get the hang of it yet, so either way, uh, this has been Blazy Alex video of the day, a blog day, a real video for once, not the just stand still image. Sorry about that again, I can't apologize enough. And, um, before I go I'm just happy that a few of my subscribers know about my, um, let's not -- my play view channel now, Blaze Outs, The Gamer, apparently they may not know or probably wouldn't want to know until I make a video called XXXX and they kind of say, hey he's doing let's play not let's placelace screws. Let's place our, uh, -- that's enough of that. I'm going to go ahead and close this video out with a have fun with it.
