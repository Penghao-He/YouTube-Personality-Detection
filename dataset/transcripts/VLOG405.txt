So -- I'm now gonna have a -- sorry about that. I'm now gonna have a categorized video sort of thing. There's gonna be a news section, a gaming section, a film section perhaps, and other sections. And that's how I'm gonna roll from now on, perhaps I'm gonna do it. So, yeah. So here it is. Here's the news. 
So, I came in this morning you know, I was gonna go to the petrol station, grab a drink, go see the missus. You know, get on my bike as normal. Riding off and I think oh, steering feels real weird. Next thing I thought yeah, I'll come back home, check the tires. Check the front tire, that's fine, I'm thinking all right, I'll check the back tire. Bloody flat. Ooh yes. So I thought okay, get the bike up on a centre stand, slowly pushing the wheel around, I see this tiny little bloody pin which turned out to be a tiny little pipe which really pissed me off, you know no Squeaky to ride on, no biking videos, fuck you know? 
Gaming news. I went and ordered Operation Flashpoint and Dragon Rising off Steam today and let me tell you that game is such a disappointment. I expected more like a hell of a lot of people on the forum did as well. If Steam could do a refund I'd want one, I want a refund for this game. Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising is about the fucking worst disappointment I've had ever. You know they claim oh yes, it's gonna be better than Armed Assault Two, you know those people oh, it's gonna be better than Armed Assault Two. It's not, plain and simple. Yes Armour two does have it's faults and glitches but yes, but do you hear me at interactive studios they do work then they've bollocked off, and they've got such a big community of fans that you go on the server that they've modded the game files so much, the game's bloody well enjoyable. You go on Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising you know, dedicated server, fuck it, I couldn't bloody find one. I kept on losing connection, you know for no reason. I'm on sixty megabites for Christ sake you know, I'm six hundred and twenty meters away from the telephone exchange, you know and I'm losing connection. What? What's up with that. You know that game is crap. So if you're ever thinking about buying Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising, don't, it is shit. 
Other gaming news. Lepider two is out soon. Fair news. The demo if you've pre ordered it should be out tomorrow, Tuesday the twenty seventh of October so I will be playing that, because I've pre ordered it for me and the missus. Also if you like Lepider and Lepider two may I interest you in Killing Floor which you already might have and see if you've watched more of their thirteen video about Killing Floor but that is one bloody good game. It is basically a bit like Lepider two and Counterstrike. So you've got ten waves of specimens 'cause they're not zombies they're specimens. And the eleventh wave is the Patriarch which is like the main part but at the end of every wave you've got a trader which is this half caste woman who lives in a shed at different locations she spawns up. And you go to like the trader, press e or wherever you've got it binded at, and you can buy weapons such as rifles, sub machine guns, or whatever, grade launchers or whatever could someone open --
Whatever. So yeah. I guess you're gonna like it because that is bloody brilliant. They've had two of a content which had four extra playable cards in each, the first one was one pound forty nine I think it was and the second one was ninety nine p. Ninety nine p, who can resist, who can say no? I didn't and I bought it. So I think that will do for the gaming news for now which I am ranting on a bit too much about because I my movie news to do so, yeah. 
Movie news. I went to see Zombieland. Rarr. Zombieland. Yeah. I really enjoyed that film. You know, the -- I forgot his fucking name now. Bill Murray, yeah that's the geezer. Bill Murray made a cameo appearance. He was -- he played his part well. Overall a good zombie flick, go and see it. Now what else. 
Transformers Two. Ugh. What could I say. They tried and they failed. It was crap. It's okay if you're watching it when you're stoned or you're pissed but that's about it. So yeah, that's my movie news for now. 
Other news. I told you about the squeak, did I tell you about squeaky with his back tire. Squeaky being my moped. In other news as well, I bought off Amazon, Season of Rot by Eric S. Brown. Brown. Brooown. And here we go. Fast, furious and straight out of your worst nightmares. That's Greg F. Gifune, author of Children of Chaos. And there's five Zombie Novellas by Eric S. Brown, which I've already said. I haven't read it yet. But when I do, then I'll probably do another video of a review of something. Ooh, the smell of new books. Mmm! That can stay over there. That's really it for my other news. So yeah, that's about it for my other news now, so. . . I won't be doing any motor bike or moped blogs any more, well, until after Christmas. And that's about it. See ya, that's me for now.
