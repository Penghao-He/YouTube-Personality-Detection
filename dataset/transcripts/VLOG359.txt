Hello. So, um, I have some news to tell you about today. Um, it's a project my friend Sophie and I are currently undertaking. Um, it was her idea; she wanted to raise money for St. John's Ward in Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin. Um, it's the oncology ward; um, cancer ward, if you don't know. So, um, I pulled this suggestion after she had a couple of ideas as well, which I think are probably still gonna move ahead. But, um, this is the one that I think requires the most organization. 
So, um, public for poems. We're putting together a book of poetry called, well provisional title, eh, XXXX. Um, we have a set number of themes. We have poems for children, um, poems for children, love poems, poems about friendship. Uh, sad poems, uh, well you know sad -- eh, and seasonal poems. So obviously spring, summer, autumn, winter. Poems that are related to them or -- um, we have a designer/person who's going to organize the layout of the book, um, and make it nice and pretty and that is my cousin, the lovely XXXX. Uh, she volunteered her services, didn't have to ask her. It's great, isn't it. 
Um, deadline for poems is December fifteenth. We're hoping to get a release in February. We're going to be posting through lulu. com; self publishing site. Um, but there will be orders available. If you know me personally, as in, you know, face to face, you're able to talk to me; um, I will be doing bulk orders that way. Um, because it'll save you money on postage and packing, we'll just have to charge you the cost of the book. 
Um, so yeah, that -- there'll be a link to the blog, which -- tonight is Tuesday the seventeenth. I'll be setting that up tonight, um, and so it will be going up on Wednesday the eighteenth. Um, there will also be a link to the Facebook page that, em, uh, Sophie set up. It's under Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin fundraising page. Um, I think the blog should be about the poetry book, so there is a running order based on what's happening. 
And it may -- well, don't hold me to this, but it may be an annual thing. But, if not try to get your poem in, as soon as possible. Um, we will be going first come, first serve -- we'll be choosing this based on what poems we like best, or poems who can work best together. And, please specify what theme that you're submitting the poem to, so that it makes it easier for us to do our job, because we have -- how many themes? Eight themes and we're hoping to have, maybe eighty to a hundred poems, so you know please make our job a little easier by specifying what you're submitting the poem for. 
Um, there will be an email address, all sorts of stuff, on the blog post and on the Facebook page and I will add that to the sidebar whenever it is created. 
Okay, um, so best of luck writing your poems and please submit December fifteenth. Thank you, bye.
