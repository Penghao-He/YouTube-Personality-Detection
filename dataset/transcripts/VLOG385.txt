Hey Nerd piteria . Right now you're probably wondering why is this girl dressed up like Harry Potter? Well, that's for a really good reason. The charity I'm supporting today in my Project for Awesome Video has really changed my life. And so, it's Harry Potter. So, let's get to it. 
In the summer of two thousand and eight, I was diagnosed with a mild form of epilepsy, which meant my arms would shake when I would wake up in the morning sometimes, and they would consider this a seizure. Then in January of two thousand and nine, I had my first grand seizure in which my whole body seized up and I ended up hitting my head before blacking out. Um, this is an experience that changed my life and really freaked me out. 
ï»¿The charity that I'm supporting this year is the Epilepsy Foundation. Um, for a couple of reasons. First they use all their money for a lot of research; and ways to prevent and treat epilepsy and make life for those who are epileptic better. And also because, um, after I had my grand mall seizure I was able to go on there and talk to people who have, um, had grand mall seizures before. And talk about them and relate to them, because there's nobody, um, for me to talk to in real life about what I was going through. It's really a great organization and one that's really close to my heart and it would mean a lot to me if could help it out this year, um, so yeah. DFTBA
