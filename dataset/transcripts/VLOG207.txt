Hey there YouTubers. This is XXXX, a. k. a XXXX and I just wanted to let you know that, uh, for today being YouTube's Project for Awesome, I would like to offer support for St. Jude Hospital for children. And the reason that I'd like to offer my support and promote St. Jude Hospital is because recently I lost a friend - a dear, dear friend to a brain tumor, and uh, at his wake, one of the things that was mentioned, of course, was that any donations made in his name go to Saint Jude Hospital in the name of cancer research for children to fight child cancer problem. So, uh, I just wanted to let you know being today's that special day - support St. Jude Hospital for cancer research, hopefully not only for children, but for everyone in the world, we can eliminate cancer. Once again, thanks YouTubers.
