It has also been non scientifically proven that big men likes facial hair. You're also welcome. 
La, la, la , La, la, la, La, la, la, , la, la, la, . 
Hey darling, so I'm kinda glad that you apparently like this thing that's going on around here. It makes it almost seem worth it. The real reason I'm actually doing this, guys, if you haven't, like, followed my Twitter or my Daily Booth or anything like that; I'm taking part in what they call Movember. It's pretty much a month long event in which guys grow their mustaches and facial hair to raise money to raise awareness for prostate cancer. 
Obviously, this is my first time, like properly growing out any form of facial hair. So it's gonna take a few more practice runs because the mustache isn't really there, hence the chin stuff to sort of even out the balance. Really, my face is just a bit awkward. Anyway, like I said, I'm raising money. So obviously, it's based on sponsors. I've got a donation page on the Movember website, link in the sidebar. Again, if you haven't been following me on Daily Booth, I have a proposal for people who donate. Anyone who donates any form of money to my page can leave a message in which they can leave me a challenge. And I said that for every twenty pounds I raise, I'll do one of the challenges that has been set for me in a video. 
It's just another little event to get you guys involved, because you know what, it's for charity and men's health is really important. But men, you'd better make the most of this for the time being, because in about a week, there's gonna be an event where I'm going with some of my workmates. We're just gonna sorta compare mustaches and have a bit of a shave off. 
So, yeah, this time next week, this will be gone, sorry. So yesterday was our eighteen month anniversary, or mensiversary, as people like to continuously correct us. So happy anniversary. darling. I'm glad that the eight ball said that we're going to work out because, as you know, I totally put my faith in those things. 
I'm just going to bring up a quick point from the comments and XXXX last video. Now, as you know, she actually got the question as to what we should do for our eighteen month anniversary. What neither of us were expecting was a badge of comments of people saying go to Scotland, or XXXX, go to Australia or meet each other halfway. Now, guys, you do realize the anniversary was yesterday and XXXX posted her video like, four days ago, which doesn't really give us that much time to just jump on a plane. Believe me, if we were made of money, we would probably be doing these things on a regular basis anyway. So if people can't really grasp the fact that we're not just setting off to the ends of the planet for the good of our health, it can get a little bit frustrating. Now, I don't want to get all huffy and oversensitive about the subject, but you know, if we're gonna make this channel work, then you guys have to realize that there are a lot of very good reasons why me and XXXX aren't together right now. 
Anyway, subject change. XXXX, you mentioned that it was a normal thing in your childhood for guys to wink at you. Well, I'd scratch my beard, because that's really weird. Well not weird per se, it's just something that I didn't grow up with myself. It probably doesn't help that Britain is like the second most paranoid country in the world. There is just no trust between strangers and kids. The media is constantly out to scare kids and their parents about strangers. Anyway, the point I'm trying to say is the only stranger that would ever or to, wink at kids would've been someone in a Santa suit, actually, now that you think about it. 
Oh, God. I'm just going to wrap this up with some questions before it gets gross. One, what's the weirdest thing you've ever done for charity? Two, if money wasn't a real issue for you, would you just want to instinctively run around the world or would you be a bit more level headed with it? And three, ? Looking forward to seeing your answers in the comments, and XXXX, I'm looking forward to seeing your new next video. See you guys.
