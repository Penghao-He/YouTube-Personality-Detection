Hi everybody. I am showing you my answering machine blinking, because I wanted to show you that this is what my brain sees. Sorry I wasn't looking at you. That makes me have seizures. My brain's not aware of all that blinking, but I mean my conscious is not aware of it, but my brain is and that messes up the wires and makes me have seizures. 
All your brains will do that. The TV will do it to you. Flourescent lights will do it to you. The computer will do it to you. And if you ever found yourself feeling kind of, I don't know, really yucky, after you get off a whole day on the computer -- I know some of you do that, that's why -- because of that blinking. Especially blinking a lot faster than what you saw, but nevertheless, that's what causes my seizures and now you all might understand better why I don't get on the computer that much. 
I love you all, have a happy Thanksgiving. Bye.
