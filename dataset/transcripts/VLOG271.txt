Okay, this is part two of my anarchy Q and A session. XXXX says I vote for capitalism, which, like democracy, is a horribly flawed system that happens to be the best thing we can come up with at the moment. However, even capitalism is starting to show its flaws like the social ones. I seriously doubt capitalism will survive another fifty years at current rates of technological development. We're perilously close to technologies capable of surpassing the abilities with respect to the specific jobs of most of the morons in our population. . My response, capitalism is nothing more than the non interference of the government in the market, and that transactions within a market should be voluntary. 
How is capitalism showing its flaws? As far as I can discern, the market trash -- the market crash was -- the market trash -- er, the market crash was triggered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were both government, er, started initiatives. They were private at the time, but the government took them -- told them to give loans to people who could not afford to have houses in the first place. The government told them that, uh, they would have their back in anything went wrong, and look at -- look at them, look at where we are now. Erm --
XXXX says, I assume jobs similar to phone tech support, cellphone operators, drive thru restaurant workers, will be among the first to go. As more and more people are displaced, even more pronounced socialist welfare estate will likely spring up, take care for the masses and morons that are literally surpassed intellectually by the machines. Thankfully, this imposes no burden at all on the society as most of the jobs necessary to provide basic resources for this displaced part of the workforce, will also be replaced by machines. Erm, yeah, I guess that's sort of a complicated problem, you know. As a philosopher, I am thinking of dealing -- of ways to deal with the economy post singularity, but that's, that's not really the current issue, right now. I believe that if machines did everything, the world would be like Utopia, we wouldn't have to worry about food and work, and we could just do whatever we wanted. I mean, that sounds great, doesn't it? Unless there's some sort of dark side, but that -- that's kind of a different problem. 
Anyways, XXXX says, but, hey, reduced government right now would be good, along with fewer laws against things that are nobody's business -- unless government meddling is business. 
Hey, even though capitalism is going to drive itself in the ground eventually, that doesn't mean it's not the right thing now. Erm, I'm saying, my response is, why reduce the government when you say that freedom causes disaster, or are you saying it didn't? 
Okay. I'm just gonna answer a few comments now. Nodayde wrote, I love the way statist assumes that it's up to you to give up your home and life you've built for yourself if you object to government extortion and thuggery. Um, Isaac Fineman -- Fineman wrote, erm, you mean the home and life you built amongst the living held of statist tyrant tyranny? And here I thought you saw statism as a real problem, but apparently you don't see it as a bad enough to even warrant moving to escape it. When one contrasts your attitude with those of people who've lived in real statist societies, like Nazi Germany and Soviet Union -- who risked their lives to leave -- I think we got a sense of the degree to which we should take your views seriously. 
I wrote, let's say, for example, you've lived in a place for a long time, a nice neighborhood, and you've built a house and generated wealth and a life for yourself. Then a group of thugs came into your neighborhood, and demanded money for protection, and forced you to pay for it at gunpoint. Do you feel you should be the one who has to leave? This group of thugs doesn't disrupt your life too much, they just come by weekly to demand protection money to protect you from another, worse, gang two miles away, who would rather, otherwise, charge more protection money. How is that -- how -- how does -- how's wanting to stay in the same place legitimizing this sort of behavior? 
Anyways, got another comment from Sorianer . Practicality is abandoned for a higher moral, intellectual ideal, or a more specifically, your higher moral ideal. So I'm being asked to abandon potential comfort for your morals? Uh, something said, no, I'm asking you to stop legitimizing the use of force against people for acceptance of it, is what gives it power. And make sure you vote -- sarcasm. 
Sorianer says, if absolutely no use of force against people is legitimate, then there's no way to address people that act to counter society. Now, just as a clarification, an anarchist is against the initiation force, so we have no problem with, you know, obtaining property that was stolen from us, because that's sort of self defense. Initiation of the force is the problem, starting, you know -- starting aggression on someone is a problem, that's what we have a problem with, and it's not just force, it's the initiation of force, anyways. 
Louden Theogen says the States is immoral. Crazypants eighty eight says, the state is funded through taxes, which is extracted with a death threat. What I mean is that if you wouldn't pay your taxes, you would be imprisoned, if you fight back you'd be killed. Anarchism one o one. 
I'm going to explain the concept of monopoly. Monopoly is when a company is allowed, by law, to force everyone to pay for their particular service. Microsoft is not a monopoly. Coca Cola is not a monopoly because they do not own one hundred percent of their sector in the market and they cannot force you to pay for their particular services. The only organization that has a monopoly is the government, because the government has the power, and apparently the right, to force you to pay for their particular services. You do not get to choose who you pay for to pave the roads, to pay for your -- or to provide hydro, protection, et cetera et cetera. You have to pay it. It's mandatory to pay for this particular service, and that's what a monopoly is. And that's why monopolies are bad, because if you are forced to pay for a particular service, whether or not it's good, there's no incentive to provide a good service, 'cause you are paying it anyways, regardless of how shitty it is and that's why government services are shitty. 
says, if you want so bad to defend anarchists, suggest that you explain in detail how you do better than the police to fight organized crime. Then how you do better than the army to deal with threatening and strong states, or you can just blame sceptics for thinking that mafias, terrorists, and selfishness still exist under the wonderful ideal society that is anarchy? 
My response, does the police fight crime, or cause crime? In the US, one in a hundred people are imprisoned, and many of them are imprisoned for a victimless crime of drug possession. I see the police as committing the crime here, unjustly incarcerating and brutalizing thousands upon thousands for drug possession. Who owns your body? Do you, or does the government own your body? If you believe in self ownership, then you believe that you have the right to consume what foods you want, even if they are in an -- unhealthy. You have the right to get tattoos, even if other people find them distasteful, and he has a right to do drugs, because the only person being affected, when you smoke a joint, is you. Furthermore, the reason -- the reason gangs and crime syndicates exist is because certain things people want are illegal, such as drugs. 
There is a market for drugs. This is why there's people, you know -- they exist the black market to provide it. For example, in Prohibition the mafia gang, er, gained enormous strength and affluence by smuggling the alcohol, and gangs ran entire cities and ran rampant in society. Alcohol is a drug, when they relegalized it -- alcohol again, these gangs lost much of their power. We don't see Budweiser and Molson -- Canadians -- shooting it out in the streets over territory. And the gang violence over drugs will cease, if drugs were -- were -- were just legalized. 
Also, the police don't defend citizens against crime. They rarely catch a criminal before they commit a crime, or even right after they commit a crime. Uh, the best way to -- to be defended, is to defend yourself. The police usually just swings by and picks up the bodies after the fact. 
Also, to deal with strong states, you can have a voluntary militia, I mean, Switzerland does it fine. I'll just read an article: at any given moment forty three hundred stationary sirens sound off in Switzerland indicating a foreign invasion and a nuclear holocaust. Within twelve hours, a militia of six hundred thousand Swiss men enrolled in, either , in aged between eighteen and forty grabbed their storm wear, M fifty seven semi automatic assault rifles and army fatigue from the closets and storm out of their apartments and chalets into the front line to protect their homeland. The Swiss army is civilian, not professional, which impressed Adolf Hitler during World War Two. In a nineteen forty --
