Hey everybody. Thanks for checking out the new video. Sorry it's so late, I had to work last Friday. Usually I don't work Fridays, my company's sweet, we only work Monday through Thursday, but because of Labor Day, I had to work. 
No time to do a video, but XXXX and I had talked about -- not XXXX, her name's not XXXX -- XXXX -- XXXX and I had talked about doing a collab together way back and she wrote the script, she wrote the shot list, it was her concept, uh, for her XXXX series. We kinda incorporated into the small life -- Living with Lino or Life of Lino sketch in one of my earlier clips, which actually I was inspired by her to do that. I was like, if she can do videos with Barbie and not get sued I can do a video with Lino and not get sued. I just don't know how that random guy does all the things with those toys and somebody hasn't gone, wait a minute. But, uh, this is actually -- people might have already seen this little response, because I tried recording it with YouTube and their upload from a webcam feature and uh, boy, did that not work. So I just turned on the old iMovie and see what happens, but uh. So make sure to check out XXXX's channel, XXXX. She also does the XXXX on XXXX, and she has a twitter account and she does lots of great stuff, so make sure to check her out, if you haven't already, from the XXXX. 
To everyone who said, my favorite's Chris, when are you going to apply for Partner? And if so, will you then be famous? Um, the answer is no, I won't be famous. The answer -- the other answer is, uh, when I hit three thousand subscribers, which I'm close to, but who knows when it'll happen, if it'll happen. So it might -- people might decide tomorrow that I suck. I can have -- wouldn't surprise me, but once I hit three grand, I'll probably apply for Partnership again to see if YouTube will accept me. Am I as funny as the other Partners, YouTube? Am I? Can I bask in the same glow and as -- I'm not going to name the names, 'cause I don't like most of them. Um -- but, uh, thanks for your support, thanks for watching. Um, stay I'm famous? Thanks a lot, guys, girls, keep watching, subscribe, comment, pay, ya, ya, ya, va, va, va. Say I'm famous.
