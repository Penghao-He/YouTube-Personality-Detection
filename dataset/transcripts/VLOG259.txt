you're such a child. Ha, ha, ha sorry. Oh come on, you already know this -- or two. Do good work, may God bless. But I do hope to see you guys again. 
Hey guys, so to explain what -- thing in the beginning of the video back there was, well, all those clips were actually clips from another video -- a video that is not on my channel. Why is that video not on my channel? 
Because I subbed for Wednesday on XXXX 'cause I think Wednesday's just up and left. I don't know, but yes, I subbed for Wednesday on XXXX, and I am proud of the video I made, so I want you guys to follow the link and the sidebar and go check it out. XXXX will also be a link to their channel on the sidebar as well, youtube dot com slash user slash XXXX all one word and uh, yes. 
So, what else is there? Yes, I'm very proud of that video -- I guess, as far as production quality, it's a better video because I put more effort into it, but yeah. Uh, I was sitting on a chair by my desk with a spotlight on me, no I'm just using the light from the sun, sitting on the bed, yeah. 
In other news, I also received my plaques but I am in a Skype crawl Sunday while I'm doing this. I seem to always be in a Skype crawl. There'll be more on that later, but anyway. 
In the mail, yesterday as I was making the video or I realized that I got something about this. It is a Sandisk Cruzer. It makes me happy because if you don't know, it's a USB drive. An eight gigabyte thumb drive and that makes me happy. has flash memory. It makes me happy. See it, now you don't. Ha ha ha, but yes. 
Um, also yesterday -- 'cause yesterday was a busy day, I went to Cape Gerardo up in Cape -- by the Mississippi River, and I bought all sort of stuff including a pair of pants. They make me happy. And a new jacket, . And yes, I don't know what that meant, I think that meant this is good, in Similish , but yes. It's comfortable, and it's very warm, which is a good thing because I actually need this in November when I go up for my aunt's wedding reception in New York City, 'cause I have family in New York City, and go up there at least once a year and I haven't gone this year. So that's sweet. 
Um, sorry, it was annoying me. Sorry you had to see that. I have issues. That's pretty much all I wanted to share with you because yesterday was a good day and I made a video on somebody else's channel and I wanted to let you guys know where the video was, so please go check out the video, leave a comment, and rate and comment here as well, please, thank you. I still have videos in the works, they will be up, don't worry. So until next time, do good work, may God bless, see you.
