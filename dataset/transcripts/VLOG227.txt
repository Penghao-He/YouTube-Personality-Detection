Here it is, Friday morning to you. It's XXXX from XXXX dot com coming to you live from, well, you know, my house in New Hampshire. Can we sell this house, yet? Uh, well, what I I'm gonna try to be unplugged this weekend. Um, tomorrow is my boys' double birthday party. Taylor will be one on the nineteenth and A. J. just turned three yesterday. Had some drama today; he, um, wants to play his new Wii game I allowed him to pick out. It's called Pet -- Petz Dogz Two, and, um, unfortunately, brought it home and found out there's a lot of reading involved with the game and he obviously cannot read. My six, almost seven year old, daughter can read, so I had her help him; it just turned into a fight. So I'm coming tell -- tell you, that I'm basically going to try to be unplugged most of the weekend. I'll probably be on Twitter a little bit and Facebook, but overall, I won't be out there too, too much, because this weekend is going to be all about my family. I am going to get back into time to spend weekends with my family, versus working all weekend, because that's what's important, uh, making sure you create those long lasting memories with your little ones before they're -- before you know it, they'll be adults and you'll wonder where the time went. So I invite you to have some family time and if you do get on line, you can stop on over to happilyblended. com. You can watch a little bit of my videos, which will be headlined Saturday morning. You can also check back -- check on my Giving Back project, which I am looking for many people to get involved. My first annual one, next year, I hope to get even bigger. This year I'm focusing on, uh, New Hampshire needy families and I really can use some support in corroding , supporting, um -- just getting the word out. I'd really like to get this big this year. Um, it's very important to me to give back to families that need things. And, um, it's the only one I can think of this year. Hopefully I'll think of other great projects in the upcoming years. So, again, it's XXXX dot com. I'm XXXX, and I'm planning off for the weekend, so have some great fun and times. Bye bye.
