Hey guys. So, everybody's quitting because, well possibly I don't really know why Lenny's quitting, but my topic is called sorry, because I'm worried sometimes because they - those two quit, and none of them even because I quit, now, too. Because like, without those two it's only me, XXXX, and XXXX. And no offence, XXXX, but you really don't put up your vids. So, um, tomorrow, Thursday, will be my last bloggers video because I already filmed it Tuesday. And, I just want to tell you guys bye, it was great. Um, tomorrow, Thursday, um, will make my um, last - will make my last official video and Thursday -- what's it called? Thursday will be my thirteenth video I did on bloggers. I wish we could a did more but everybody was too busy, but you can always - I'm not leaving. Like everybody else, I'm not leaving YouTube, so I don't understand why we have to quit. Everybody has to leave the bloggers channel without leaving their main channel. So, I'm done and I was so sad to subscribe to this channel. And if we do, if other people do join, like if we do held -- hold auditions or whatever, um, yeah, if other -- if other people join this channel, like we get people, I will love to come back, if I still had that opportunity, I would love to come back to you guys, but I just can't, so. It was fun while it lasted, and enjoy my last video tomorrow because I really want to do the challenge that I made still, so it was nice. And please keep in contact with my main, 'cause I still make videos, like, . But please, if XXXX, like, if you want to get together and hold auditions with me, I will love that. We can just like, and we gonna start our own, like another blogger. If you want XXXX, we could like, hold auditions so, just let me know. Otherwise from then, bye, farewell, see you my friends.
