Hey guys. Um, so these past few days haven't been, um, the best, um, mainly because one of my friends, XXXX, he passed away on Monday. God, I don't even know if I should be making this right now. It's been pretty hard on all of us. It was especially hard for me 'cause -- I mean, I've never had anyone somewhat close to me die. 
I talked to him the night before 'til, like, midnight or something, and the funny thing was he just wouldn't stop complimenting me and -- and just -- he was just being so nice and I -- I just took everything for granted. 
It's really hard, because I never got to know him long enough, you know. I didn't have enough time to spend with him. We had all these plans to do all these different things and we'll never get to do them, you know what I mean? And he was my age, I mean -- it's way too young to die. In a short span of life I think he lived it up as much as he could, you know? When I was talking to him the night before , we made a plan to go on a date this weekend, but -- I'll just -- I'll be going to his funeral instead. He was going to go to fashion school. He had -- he had such a future. All he ever wanted to do was just see The Nutcracker. So it's been a tough couple few days, and my friends and I are getting by by helping each other, you know? So I just wanna say to all his family and friends who happen to watch this, um, my prayers are with you and him. Anyways, um, I'm sad because he was just the nicest guy you'll ever know. 
We'll all miss -- we'll all miss him a lot, very much. So yeah, sorry if I don't make any videos anytime soon. Life is not going so well right now, but we'll get by. Rest in peace, XXXX . And I promise, next time I see you we'll go on our date, and we'll go on our little photo adventure and all the things we planned to do. I promise.
