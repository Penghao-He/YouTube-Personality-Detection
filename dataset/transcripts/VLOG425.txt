Ah, good lighting. So background change, guess what that means? I've moved. Yeah, and my room sounds really echo ey. I haven't really talked in it before, so, yeah. 
But, hey, um, I got home from Ansi on Friday to find out that they had moved my moving day to Saturday instead of today, so I've basically packed everything and I pretty much got everything. I forgot some things, but that's okay; they can give it to me. My old host parents are just, you know, like, ten, fifteen minutes away so. 
But anyway, so I have no internet in my room which is a sad fact, but I think that it's better because that means that I have to be downstairs when I want to use the computer. But they do have Wi Fi. I almost said weefee again, that's how they call it, weefee, new pronunciation. Beyond moving to my new to host family, also, um, with the XXXX we had to do a change of people which meant a change of days so now I'm Mondays. So if you go to the YouTube channel XXXX tomorrow at some point, after school for me, there will be a video up of me. Yeah, XXXX, and links in the sidebar. 
I'm going to give a shout out now to basically all of my friends who were completely awesome and sent me Christmas cards and presents and stuff. Like seriously, I came home from Ansi and I had two packages and three letters on my bed. That made my day, like completely and it was like -- Ray, you're amazing. I loved my presents. I used this all the time and there were like, seven other things, oh yeah, like this friendship bracelet, yay! But yeah, she gave me like eight things as a kind of a Hanuka ey things. 
XXXX, thank you for the card; you made me happy. XXXX, I love you. And another thing when I got here last night, there was already a package. I bought some books on Amazon and it said that one of the books was going to come on the sixth, well it came earlier like, on the second or something. So maybe that means that my other books won't come on the twenty sixth -- they'll come like on the twentieth which would be awesome. 
But so now I have Inkdeath and I'm so excited. This, like the series is so good and the movie is coming out this month. I found out that it has been translated into French and it's coming out on the twenty eighth. So that means that day isn't going to be depressing for me; it's going to be awesome. I'm not going to explain that depressing part. 
I already started reading it and I really wish that I had the first two books but they have a synopsis of the first two books in the front of the book which is really cool which, and it really helped. 
Last night my host brothers and their older brother, who is normally in Paris, had a whole bunch of friends over and we played Rock Band for like, two hours and I sang and played bass and it was really fun, so I'm happy. 
Well, I have to go back to unpacking now, so I will see you guys on -- I'll see you guys tomorrow on Nerd Finderly Girls and on Wednesday here. 
I think I may go to a once a week with this one just because. I don't know, maybe we'll see. 
Tell me what you think down there. Bye.
