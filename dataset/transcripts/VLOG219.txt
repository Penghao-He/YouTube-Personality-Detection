Hi, everybody. So, XXXX tagged me in this YouTube game. So me and XXXX are going to share five facts about me and then I'm going to tag five more people who have to share five facts. 
So, fact number one. I was born in Alaska. Here's the photographic evidence. That's me, baby Katie with my Dad, and a sled dog. Oop, there we go, there, much better, okay? And my Dad raised me and he didn't have a choice. And when I was five we moved away. 
Uh, here's another fact. I am fascinated by the history of the American West. Um, the frontier town, the gold rushes, the Oregon Trail, outlaws, our clashes between the Native Americans, all of it. I love it. Um, and I haven't done much to pursue that interest, other than watch movies, read books, and become a dedicated fan of Deadwood, may it rest in peace. 
Here's another fact. I am the oldest of three children, and my little sister is fourteen years younger than me, and she's awesome. 
Alright, final fact. I have huge literary crushes on Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor and James Tiptree, Jr. , aka Alice Sheldon. I just love great story telling and really freaky dark stuff, and those ladies do it for me. 
So now that I'm no longer it, I'm going to choose five YouTubers to um, answer, to be it now. I'm tagging, um, XXXX, because he asked, XXXX, and then three YouTube users in Spanish, . 
Alright, have fun guys. Bye.
