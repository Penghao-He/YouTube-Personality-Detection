Hi, it's been a long time, yeah. Do you ever notice that I do that a lot? Yeah, um, I was going through my videos and I realized that I haven't done the kind of blog that I like doing since July. I haven't made one of those blogs where I just chit chat to you about everything that crosses my mind as it crosses my mind. I like doing that it just gets everything off the chest. So I decided okay, it might be time. And have you noticed anything? The camera angle is, like, different because my whole desk is in a different spot. I've got, like, a log here to smash my head on if ever the temptation over comes me or something, yeah no. Also I've got the fuzzy hair now. You see the story behind that is that I wanted a body perm so just to have a little bit of volume in the hair and it turned out something like this, you know, chka chka chk, a little too curly to my liking. It was accidental, but you live with it. Me -- I went and paid like money to have to flatten my hair every morning like people do that I never had to do, and I went and paid money to have to dry my hair for like a half hour before it's nearly completely dry, which I never had to do. It -- it -- it will go back to normal eventually. Hopefully, I think. 
Also I've changed jobs since the last time. I think I may have mentioned that before, but I don't know so I'm just going to repeat myself up. Naw, I must not have because I started like three weeks ago. I work in this little gift shop. It's in the middle of this mall in my small town and I have never realized how many weird people live in my town. Its ridiculous -- yeah I'll just hang out at the mall -- you just see the weirdest freaking people pass by. You're just like, whoa, where the hell did that person come from? What were they doing? I really want to shirt, the one that says, I thought we were dancing, my bad, that would be like awesome dude, just fits my personality so much. That would be awesome. 
I've been watching an insane amount of movies lately. Hah, oh, do you remember about this time last year I made a video about turning twenty and I was like super panicked -- for all you old subscribers there-- I was like super panicked about being twenty, I was like good lord I'm going to be twenty, yeah I'm turning twenty one soon. Twenty didn't turn out so bad, I mean I still have a few days to go. Actually I've got a little while to go still, about a month or so, a bit more than a month. But hey, this far into the twentieth year was quite good. Maybe it all will go all down hill from here but so far it went good. Year of change, year of change. 
So yeah, tons of good stuff going on, good job, good stuff, uh, uh, the other job, good stuff also, not being at the old job, freaking good stuff and maybe getting this internship, most likely, probably. I am really trying like to tone it down so that I'm not super disappointed if I don't get what I want, you know. I'm pretty sure I'm getting it though, so that like freaking awesome and I hope a nice visit for my birthday which is happening soon, get like, friend visiting from Europe for two weeks and then, and then -- oh yeah, things are going good. And I'm hopefully going to be making more of these because um, I miss it. I don't know about you guys but I miss it. When you guys play you're like, fuck, more of this stuff going on and I will be like, ha, ha, ha ha, more of this stuff going on. Yeah, okay, I think I've -- I think -- I think that's enough. I shall see you again in July. No, hopefully we'll see you before July -- yeah, before July.
