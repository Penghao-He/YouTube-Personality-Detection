Hi guys. You know that feeling when you kind of forget someone's name. It happens all the time at church. It happens . It happens unless they're on Facebook, I don't know their name pretty much and so -- but people know my name so they'll come up to me and, like, hey Tara and I'll be like hey you, yeah you. And then you know you do that thing when you're kind of like I'm going to try and guess your name. I'm gonna go back and sneakingly try and get you to say your name so I know what your name is. Yeah, a bit like this. 
 So yeah, give me your number so that -- and then I'll call you back on project relax. So, uh, yeah, definitely call me back. So is that ? So how do you spell your name again? My name? Oh, F. F? Yeah Fuck you. . Oh, that's sweet that . Good thing I asked. 
Thanks to everyone who subscribed to me in the last week. I'm really sorry I haven't gotten the chance to thank all of you personally. I put two hundred subscribers now. Say whoopee. I've had a lot -- you know, been really busy. I mean, like, my friend Weisel came up with a camera and I love Weisel to pieces. Love you Wiesel. And so he's been staying with me the whole week and so we've done lots of charity things like , walk around Kookai. Also with Easter coming up, I made church . It's a busy time anyway so you know. I'm like flat out. We're doing this young bonfire at night so it's like sit around the campfire, eat as much desert as you can, roast some marshmallows and a few of us are gonna be sharing like, why we are still Christian and what it means for us and how we actually got to be Christians in the first place. So, I'm really excited for that and I might even work out, you know, the great way of telling my story and post it up on YouTube, you know, you never know. Story -- give your ideas about and summer here. Hey, so busy time. I want to do the fun stuff. I don't know why. It looks so cheese look .
