Okay, so, I'm really, really wet right now and it's kind of weird for me to be videotaping this, but I have to say it, I have to say it. So, it's just great. Uh, so, I'm really wet right now, 'cause it's raining outside, and that it's raining outside, but you might be able to hear it, but probably not. It's like super duper rain, but pouring, and it's fucking pouring outside. And I'm really wet, and I was on my porch, and I was dancing around in the rain and it was so fun. It was like, ridiculously fun. I was dancing around and I'm like, oh, I'm so wet and I don't care, and I'm freezing cold, but I don't care, and there's like, water pouring down my face, but I don't care. I just -- I don't care about anything right now. I'm just so happy. Just like, I don't care who's staring at me because I'm dancing in the rain. I don't care how weird people would think I am, because I think this is the -- one of the most beautiful days I've ever seen. I don't care what people think of me. I don't care what happens now. I can fucking face anything, and I don't care, and I'm so happy and I'm fucking wet. And I don't know, its just like, uh, like, it's like what do you keep trying to tell me. You keep trying to tell me to not care what other people think about me; not care what I do; just do what I want to, and just be who I am and just be happy with who I am, and know, that no matter what I do, I'm gonna be okay. And right now, when I -- when I was out there dancing, when I was just getting drenched, when I was standing there staring at the sky, having the water fall down on me, I knew that I was gonna be okay and I knew that everything was gonna be okay. And I don't know, I just feel pretty amazing right now. 
So I'm videotaping it because uh, it's kind o' like, um, gonna be kind o' weird to call you right now and tell you about this. And I don't even know if I'm ever gonna let you see this, I don't know. I'm just so happy right now and so wet; and I'm shouting and I'm probably freaking out my dogs. But, oh, my God, oh, this is so amazing. I feel so amazing right now. I don't know. I just feel like, it doesn't matter what happens. It doesn't matter what anyone does. It doesn't matter if I leave. It doesn't matter. I -- don't know, nothing really matters, it's just, I'm me, and I'm dancing in the rain and I'm so happy. It's just this moment, this moment, it's just amazing. And I'm really -- it doesn't make sense, but I don't care. I don't care what people think about me, really, because I'm so happy right now. And I don't care that I'm shaking my laptop, because I'm just ecstatic and kind o' crazy, and crazy, but I don't care. And I can't stop laughing, which is kind of weird I know, uh, it's like, I'm standing out there in the rain dancing and laughing. I'm like, this is weird. But whatever, it's awesome! And I'm also talking really funny, and I'm kind o' shaking right now 'cause of the cold, 'cause it's super wet. Like, you can't tell with this shirt 'cause its black, but its pretty wet, too. And my hair is soaking wet, like, my hair was completely dry before. This is all from the rain. Oh, my God! Oh yeah, I'm really happy and excited and I feel like I've had a sudden realization, even though all I've been doing is dancing in the rain. All right, I feel kind of amazing. 
So, thank you for like, all the times you've told me to be myself, and all the times you told me how amazing I am, and all the times you told me not to worry about what other people think, or not to worry about what's gonna happen. Because you're right! You're right, you're right, I shouldn't -- you're right. I'm awesome, you're right. I don't need to worry about all the stuff and I don't need to care. And like, it's the simple things that make you so happy, like dancing in the rain. So thank you so much. And I know that I'm gonna be okay, and I know that you're gonna be okay and I know that just everything's gonna be okay. And in the end, we'll all end up happy. So thank you.
