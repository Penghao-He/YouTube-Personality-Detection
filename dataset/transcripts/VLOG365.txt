Hey, it's Friday!  
And as you can see behind me, it is definitely winter. It's so cold, but considering the theme, I felt it was appropriate to tape outside. I wouldn't exactly call myself team winter, because I can't really pick a favorite season, but I do like winter and I'm glad it's not like this year round, but I have fun when it comes, you know, just for a few months and stuff. Because, you know, it's kinda fun, even though it's freezing. And also, I'm a pretty big fan of Christmas music and Christmas in general and ice skating and Christmas movies and Christmas. And it's also fun to go sledding with my friends and I can't think of a better way to spend an evening than reading by a fireplace when you can see, like, snow outside and it's just, like, super toasty in the house, but it's like, mmm, the best. Oh, and hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, hot chocolate. 
I'm not really sure what else to talk about when it comes to winter, but I thought maybe favorite Christmas movies might be a good topic of conversation. And I think you girls should answer this question too, in maybe your videos next week or something. Just tell us what some of your favorite Christmas movies are and commentors {sic}, you should leave me comments and tell me what some of your favorite Christmas movies are. Some of mine are -- oh hello, hee hee hee, my dad came outside because I'm taping this later in the day, after I got back from work instead of taping it in the morning, like I usually do. Oops. My favorite Christmas movies are: I really like While You Were Sleeping, I love It's a Wonderful Life, I really like The Muppet Christmas Carol, because it's awesome and it has awesome songs in it and I get them stuck in my head and it's fantastic. And A Christmas Story, and Elf, Elf -- so funny, best Christmas movie ever, except not really the best one ever, because I like a lot of Christmas movies, but it's one of my favorites. It's good. 
I really can't think of anything else to talk about and it is cold out here, so I think that I'm just going to make this video really short. So sorry if it's really, really short and Megan , I'll see you on Monday. Stay sweet.
