Hello everyone, and welcome to Wednesday; Thursday. Hello everybody, and welcome to Thursday. 
So, this is . Uh, see, it -- it's getting a little better. It -- it's looking real good. Before it was just like, it was fat, but it looks good now. And my name is, uh -- has become a lot more of a conversational piece because people actually look at it now. Uh, because before when I said my name, it was just like I said it and nobody really asked me any questions, 'cause it wasn't on the table, sort of thing. So now, everyone of my the tables asks me the question, "Oh, is that XXXX? " I'm like -- sometimes I just just say, yeah. If I'm XXXX, my name is XXXX. It's XXXX. Doesn't matter . 
Got rid of this desk in my room, so my room is bigger now; and now I have just one big desk. Oh, yeah. My room is bigger now, because I have a small room to begin with. I began to notice recently that I've been contracting a -- an obsession to ties, as, um, I bought five more ties. They just look so cool, but it's the only part of my uniform that's different than everybody else's, and I like to have -- like having a good amount of ties. I finally conjured enough money to go and buy Farm Worker Two. I'm gonna go do that as soon as I'm done making this video, um, because I had to return it four days ago, and now I'm having withdrawal from the video game. So I need to go make a purchase. 
Today is the sixteenth of December, which leaves only nine days before Christmas. And, um, I was thinking should not buy people things for Christmas. They should just buy people gift cards or things, or just give people money. Because the value of your money is ten times better after Christmas anyways. So what's the point of spending more before? Just, like, two or three days; you just might as well wait. 
So I went to work the other day, and there's like two forty year old women and their two sixteen year old sons. And both of the women were drunk. They had just been drinking wine, since they -- they were on the wait to be sat at a table. They're sitting at the bar drinking, and then when they got to my table, they'd had -- don't you love just finding things in your mouth, like -- they're uh -- they're drinking their wine, and, um, "Do you all -- do you 'all like nuts? " Because I wasn't going to talk about the desert, but nuts isn't like nuts. The lady goes, "Well, are you talking about the nuts on the food? " And I was just like, did this lady really just say this to me? And her sixteen year old son is like, "Mom, that is so inappropriate. " And then I said, "That's what I was thinking. " But then I proceeded to telling her that I thought it was funny that she had said that, because it was really off the wall, I was not expecting her to make a joke about my nuts. But that shows people for you when they're drunk. 
On that note, I'm going to see you all later, maybe this week, if I decide to make a video, um. Bye.
