Hey everyone, I just want to talk about something that has been in the news lately -- well at least American news -- and it's the balloon boy. For all of you international viewers who don't know who the balloon boy is, apparently there is this family who lives in Colorado and they are crazy; and they basically believe in aliens and do all this weird like scientist shit, except not real science, because they believe in all this wacky crap. And basically they set off a balloon, not like a little toy balloon, but this weird spaceship shaped balloon; and the father set it off and then they realized they couldn't find their son. They thought their son was in the balloon and we've been calling him the balloon boy for the past day or so. And he was like -- and the balloon was floating over Colorado for two hours; and for two hours we all thought that this boy was floating in this balloon. 
And then the balloon lands, and we realized that it's empty and we realized the boy was actually in the attic of the house; and he wasn't in the balloon; and we were all just talking about a balloon floating in the sky for two hours. 
Yeah, so it's understandable that we would cover that, because you know there was a chance that this boy could have died. He was like floating around in space, but he wasn't. That's the point. He wasn't in the balloon, and even though we're learning more about this family, how they're kinda of crazy and how they are bad parents, but, um, that's not news; that's really -- that's not news. Um, and even though it's not news our media has decided to cover it twenty four seven. By our media I mean, CNN; FOX, which no one should watch and MSNBC. These three major news stations, even my beloved MSNBC can't stop talking about the balloon boy. 
Honestly, really, the stock market just went over ten thousand or whatever for the first time in over a year. It's going up. It's going up. Do you remember I said that in my last video? People like, yeah, Barak Obama it's going up and it's hit a record point for over a year, but we're talking about a little boy that we thought was in a balloon that wasn't. Really. 
The health care debate is finally coming to like to a merging point where the Congress and the Senate have to like agree to merge a final bill and we're talking about a boy who we thought was in a balloon but wasn't. Really. 
You know when our society crumbles before our eyes and when Sarah Palin takes over the world with Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and we look back at where did we all go wrong. It's when our media started talking about the balloon boy. It's when our media decided that the balloon boy was more important to discuss than the stock market, healthcare, the economy -- you know, the stimulus package that is working by the way. You know, big stuff like that, no, no, no, we're going to talk about the balloon boy. And even after the balloon boy has landed, we're going to talk about how bad the parents of the balloon boy are, and then we're going to put that family on every single freaking news show in the next twenty four hours, interview after interview and watch the little boy. He literally threw up on television. On the Today Show this morning, he threw up. He vomited on television. News show after news show, this is what we're talking about, you know -- Barak Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, healthcare go merging, fuck that. Stimulus bill -- it's working, more signs that it's working, fuck that. Stock market hits ten thousand for the first time in over a year, fuck that. We're not even talking about like anything that could possibly be twisted to be related to current events. No, we're talking about the balloon boy. 
You know, Thomas Jefferson talked about an enlightened electorate and electorate and the only way that democracy can succeed is if we have an enlightened electorate. Meaning that voters know -- know what they are talking about. How are we supposed to know what we are talking about when the people who are supposed to tell us are talking about a balloon boy?
