Hello everyone. It's been a long time since I made a video so I thought that I probably should. 
Not much has been up with me. On Halloween, I dressed up as a fairy. And I've still been trying to find a job. I actually had an interview today, so hopefully the job soon. It's now been a little over two months since I have been back to America and I have started to really miss Japan a lot lately. I had a lot of people ask me before whether I preferred living in America or Japan, and you know, there are pros and cons of living in both countries so of course it's going to depend on the individual person. I'd probably say that if all of my family and my good friends lived in Japan and I knew how to speak and understand Japanese fluently, then I probably would rather live in Japan. It feels like when I was in Japan I was just less stressed out, relaxed, and I just had a good feeling while I was there. 
In America, of course, I can understand the language and it might be a little easier to do everyday things here. But I do miss the friendly, polite people in Japan, and I miss the scenery and architecture even, totally just because I've lived in America for so many years that it's just boring to me now. I don't know how people from other countries view American architecture but it feels like, to me anyway, I prefer the architecture in other countries. I actually at one point had a list of a lot of ideas for videos that I wanted to do and I tried finding the list and I can't find it. I made the list in Japan, but I made sure that I packed it so that I'd have it here. Um, so hopefully I'll be able to find that soon and make some more -- more planned videos. You can see a little bit of my apartment in the background. This apartment complex was built in the nineteen sixties so there's some lovely wood paneling behind me. I'm not so into the wood paneling but it's pretty cheap rent so, I can handle it. 
Probably one of the reasons I haven't been on YouTube in so long is that I kind of got addicted to NetFlix and Dexter. I've been watching a lot of movies. I just saw a lot of footage that I haven't put together from Japan so, I'll try to do that soon too for you guys and I will have to leave you. Goodbye.
