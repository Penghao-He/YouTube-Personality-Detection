XXXX, are you okay? Are you okay, XXXX? XXXX, are you okay? Are you okay, XXXX? Oh, hey guys, um, this is our XXXX got suspended and possibly forever -- basically forever, yeah. Um, okay, um, it was maybe a year ago, um, maybe less, maybe not half a-year ago but maybe a little bit more that a half a-year ago. I have first got my -- actually when did XXXX come out? Was that, it was in May of two thousand and eight? I think. Maybe. I'm not sure. Um, but that's why I put this video up. The video was Will Farrell's The Landlord. Everyone knows that video. Everyone knows, um, who's battling the internet about The Landlord video. So I put it not knowing about YouTube's -- this is when they first started, ah, do the YouTube, you're going to get zapped into suspension or deletion if you put a video up copyrighted by a celebrity or anything. So I didn't know about it, uh, they first started to do it. So it was this -- I posted a video maybe at two o'clock or three o'clock in the morning, um, because -- am I frozen right now? Yeah I think I was frozen I'm not sure. Sorry, my computer may have just said that. Um, but it was at two or three o'clock in the morning because I remember my sister went to The Dark Night opening at midnight and I stayed up all night on the computer so I put The Landlord up. Maybe five minutes, ten minutes later YouTube sent me a thing, they've took it down saying -- well they've made it unavailable for people to watch. They said, if you don't take this down we will suspend and delete your account. So I'm like, okay. So I delete it. Half a-year, a year later comes, which was a couple of weeks ago and I try to log into my account and it says, this account -- you can not access this account, change email, or something like that. So I message YouTube and I say on a -- on email, and they are no help at all. And Google -- I can't call them because they don't have people to talk to. It's really confusing. Well, maybe they do. It's just really confusing for me. So I send it in and they say -- they also suspended another account that I made for Shinsei . It's an Anime, um, they also suspended that too, so it is like a double whammy. I was pretty popular on there, too. I had a lot of subscribers but still many views on my videos but it's not my videos. But anyways, let's get to the point, and on the email it said the things that made me get suspended. It had The Landlord on it and what I was thinking was, um -- my mom was screaming I'll give you a freaking buck. I don't know if you guys heard it, but yeah, dismind her she's , I don't know. Okay, but um, okay um, where was I? Oh yeah, so they say, we suspended you because of The Landlord and it said you have to settle the dispute with um, with um, with Will Ferrel or who made it, maybe from Udie dot com. I don't know, but I am pretty sure that it was Will Ferrel. It was the creator of the video I think they said, so yeah. So that's pretty impossible, um, so that's that and even, they said even if I settle the dispute with him that I probably wouldn't get my subscribers, my friends and my videos back. So if, you know, um, and so that's that with it and so I made topic revised. I'm going to make all, I'm going to redo all the episodes of um, of, ah, A D-I T-O A-L S, is that the for it? I think -- I think I said it right in the abbreviations and um, Udderface , I'm bringing Udderface back and um, and so, and so yeah, that is what's going on. I, um, there's no more highly logical of what you have read on my channel. And so yeah, basically, yeah, I am never going to get my channel back. So this is the new home, so everyone, um, I have a Twitter account. I -- I just really want people to start following me. So um, and so, yeah, that's about it. So bye, you guys, um, subscribe please, so yeah, uh, bye.
