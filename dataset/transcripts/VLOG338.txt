Welcome to XXXX. This is part one of four, counting down the top thirty one videos of the entire year. YouTube has this new page out -- Youtube dot com slash newyears, where every day they put out a new video, and it's super fun and exciting. It's the entire reason I stay up late. Waiting to see the new video get posted. So let's go right into it and cover the videos that have already been released. 
I doubt this is in any particular order. I think it's just by the day. All these videos are total collectively best videos of two thousand nine. First video -- Mister Guitar Man. Awesome, I loved Joe, his Video Guitar Impossible. Now, I love this video for the technical expertise, obviously, in the editing and everything else. But personally, I wish they would have chosen the one with the water glasses, playing them with the pens, because that was my favorite that Joe put out this year. I just fell in love with that video. 
Second video is Biscuit the Sleepwalking Dog. You knew that viral video was gonna be in this list somewhere, and it came out the second day. It's where the dog is sleeping and starts running and then like, wakes itself up and runs into the wall and it's hilarious, and it's so cute. 
Another one you knew was gonna be up there -- Fred, his One Million Subscribers video. I think it's interesting how of all the Fred videos, they chose that one. But obviously they would, because it was the first person ever to get a million subscribers on the website. So, congratulations Fred -- obviously, you had an amazing two thousand nine. 
The fourth video is the Know You're Mean Boxy video and special bonus -- they linked to original Boxy Video. Um, can you believe that Boxy came out in January, so it's pretty much been a year since Boxy came onto the scene. That just blows my mind. 
The fifth video that came out was a video I've never even seen. So it was kind of interesting to get to watch one of the popular videos of two thousand nine for the first time. It's The Guild's Alluring Avatar. It was a really funny video -- I liked it but, yeah, it was good. I -- I wish I had known about it 'cause it's one of those weird things where it's like, I've never seen this before and now I'm being told it's one of the top videos of two thousand nine. Hmm, I don't know how I feel about that. But obviously, if you've seen, you agree with it because it is a very well done video. So, congratulations to the Guild. I don't mean holding his toothpaste wasn't in the shot just then. 
The sixth video came from Shane Dawson TV. Obviously two thousand nine, we've all said was the year of the Dawson, and um, no surprise they were gonna put him on the list. But I'm very surprised that they chose his very emotional and serious Father's Day video. Yes, the beginning is very funny, but it turns very serious and very personal very quickly. And I think that day that video came out, we all got to see for the first time a very personal side of Shane. And it was such a blessing for him to share that with us. And I am very surprised that put that out there. I'm really glad they did, because I think it's awesome that he shared that with us. And you know, there lot's of people out there that don't have fathers and can very much relate to that situation, um, but I would've thought YouTube would very much keep every thing very, you know, lively and happy. And the fact that they, you know, took it serious and you know, not everything is happy go lucky on YouTube as in life -- um, I'm very, uh, proud of them. And yeah, I think it was a good thing that they chose that video. 
The seventh video that came out was United Breaks Guitars. Ouch, um -- this video is just about this guy singing about how United broke his guitar. He's a band I've never heard of -- a video I've never seen. Um, and the video -- I'm sorry, not really impressed. Six million views -- impressive. Good job on, you know, getting a viral video out there and, uh, the whole theme of this day I guess of putting this video out was -- oh, clever way to get attention to a problem. Yeah, but United didn't solve those problems, so it really wasn't that great. And if the video was a little better, United would've replaced his guitar. Ooo, bad. 
 the video they put out today, the only one we have left to talk about is We Fail Is A Big Win. Um, yes, I absolutely remember all of those we fail videos of people not having their wrist strap on and throwing the little chuck and into the TV it went. And, oh my goodness, all those plasma high def TV screens that got ruined this year because of the Wi -- oh lordy, don't even get me started on that money. But, thank God I've never done that, because I don't own a Wi, but if I did, you know that strap would be on my wrist at all times. I do not have to ruin my TV, but yeah -- hilarious, hilarious videos. I'm glad they chose that, because -- and that was kind of a very viral thing at the beginning of this year, wasn't it? I feel like it was. 
Those are all the videos that they've released so far. You need to go and check out and bookmark XXXX so you can see them come out every day. Next Tuesday will be Part Two, where I'll cover the next seven videos that they've released in those seven consecutive days. Uh, thank you so much for watching XXXX. Um, be sure to come back on Friday for XXXX. And I'm really just kind of excited for you to come back next week, because I'm really excited to see the next seven days, and I can't wait to see the rest of the videos that are the top thirty one of the year. Uh, I'm very excited obviously, and also kind of sick which is which this video was a little chit -- showy. But anyways, thank you so much and I'll, uh, talk to you all later, right? Bye.
