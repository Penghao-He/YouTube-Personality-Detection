Pretty snazzy, right? And I also wanted to make it known that Christian Bale is the only ultimate Batman out there. Like, he said, do you got any cartoons? You can't beat him as Batman, really. Just the best Batman. 
I just wanted to let you know that I colored a picture of mmmuhh -- waahaahaa. 
ï»¿Guess what time it is? Story time. Okay, so here's my story. Today me and my sisters and my mum, we had to go shopping to get some stuff because my sisters are going on tour. So we went into the dollar store, right? And I didn't have anything that I needed or anything, so I was just kind of looking on. I didn't -- I had nothing to do. And you know how it goes, stores are usually kind of dinky and boring, both things really cool, right? So I'm wandering around and wandering around and suddenly I see this like, section of the wall that's covered in super hero coloring books. Of course that gets my attention. I mean, who wouldn't wanna go look at that, really. Anyway, so I go over there and I'm looking and I'm seeing you know, Spiderman, Captain America, some Iron Man, I don't know who he is. I gotta whole -- and then I saw the greatest super hero of all time. Batman. And he has like three different kinds of coloring book. One of them was actually like waterpaint -- like watercolor paint. But that one was kind of boring. And then there was this other one that was like the jumbo Batman coloring book and I was like, oh my gosh. I started looking through it and I saw this page of stickers and I'm like oh, Batman stickers, oh my gosh. And eventually I pull myself away and we shopped a little more, and I come back to the coloring book section and there was one other coloring book and it had like these two little, like -- it was stuck like this and it opened up there about that big but like that long. And so anyway, then they have stickers on them, the same stickers as in the other coloring books, but I didn't know that. And then, feeling rough and leaving everything and I went over to their coloring book section and I sit there staring at it and staring and -- and my sister comes over and I'm like, great, I totally want to steal this sticker. And she's like, do it, I'll cover you. And she stands at my side and I turned to her. I'm like, so which one -- which one should I -- should I take 'cause I'm gonna put it on the back of my phone. And she's like, hmm. I saw this really awesome one and it was like, you know, the Batman sign and then under it says Batman begins. Um, and I was like well, it's too big, it will cover up my camera on my phone. And she's like, well, we'll think it out, well. So we're trying to pick out a smaller one and I finally picked out one that I inspected on my phone and my other sister Cynthia comes over. Well she was in my other videos. Anyway she comes over and she was like, What you doing in there? 'Cause she saw my phone and everything and she's like, oh, and she starts making a huge deal of it and I'm like -- and I like started feeling really bad. And so like, roll us out of there, right? And I'm like, I'm gonna get away with this sticker. I'm gonna get away with it. And like, she was like, shame, shame on your name. You are a stealer. You're a thief. You are stealing a sticker. A sticker. How dare you steal a sticker? 
And I was sitting there and my -- my mood of stealing stickers suddenly started going down and down and down. And I started feeling really bad about it and so then I asked my mum for a dollar and I got the coloring book. And now I can check whatever out --- whatever I want out of the family of stickers-- there's one sticker. That wasn't the original sticker that I stuck on there but I changed it 'cause it looks awesomer and it also tripped up my ipod with Batman stickers. There is the one that we wanted on there but it was too big. Anyway. 
It was a pretty exciting day. Stealing stickers and actually borrowing mum. Yeah. I just ate and it was tasty. Batman. I just want to let you know that from my Batman coloring book, I did color a picture and here it is.
