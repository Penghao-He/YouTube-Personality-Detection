I haven't made a video in forever. Anyway, hello, it's XXXX making a blog on October twentieth, yeah. I don't really have any excuses; I've just been lazy, laziness prevails. Stuff happens. I just don't feel like blogging and when I do find the inspiration to finally blog, the camera isn't charged and then I'm just, like, daaah waaah and then my mom gets home with my sister from whatever they were doing on that Saturday, ugh, annoyance, yeah. 
Uh, Windows seven comes out in two days and I am going to get a laptop soon and, um, yeah, that's going to be awesome. I also don't think I'm living up to my channel name, it's supposed to be XXXX, and I don't really make random videos. I mean I've made some in the past, where I was, like, just did some random short skit stuff, like that Christmas video thing where I was, like, an evil shocker pen person. I need to make random videos and as soon as my laptop -- as soon as I get one, I will try to instead of just blogging and telling you about my amazing life I will, um, try and do something random and funny and actually live up to my channel name, XXXX. 
Yes, if you haven't noticed my hair grew a lot. Except it's not what it used to be, it's not long, its' not my beloved emo hair -- emo hair, which I actually use a flat iron on; flat irons aren't gay. And, um, yeah, my friend he's, like, oh XXXX, you're gay, 'cause you use a flat iron, blaah, screw you. And, um, also I've been talking to my new friend about next summer, maybe is -- since -- when it grows back it'll be long and yeah -- and maybe I can kinda put streaks in it or something, but -- because I can't do that at school, because it's a private school and the hair has to be natural color and I want it to be kind of like red streaks and maybe somewhere -- I don't know. Tell me your ideas; I think it will be cool. 
I'm not really emo. I don't cut myself; see there so clean, emo, it's about the music - it's about the music, people! I also listen to indi, nerdy music, of course, and wizard rock who's amazing. And my friend, my carpool person, she's been asking me to, like, send her all my wizard rock songs and I can't, because email sucks. So, I have to, like, put it on jump drive for her and she's kinda -- she attacks me. 
It's October, yeah, it's October, so, um, last weekend or this weekend, October seventeenth, was homecoming and I went and I asked this girl. She's nice and it was fun and she didn't really dance much, but I danced with, like, people and it was fun. There was a chocolate fountain, but I only had, like, one chocolate strawberry and that was it. I didn't eat the entire night and I was really sweaty; it was hot and the music was terrible, but I mean you could dance to it; like, you can't really dance to emo music and all that, you know, uh huh. It was fun. 
Also since it's October, Halloween, it's in, like, two weekends, yeah, so I need a costume. I think I already know what I want to be. I want to be Mario and I will have, like, coveralls and, like, you -- have you seen that music video by Lou Connard with -- he's Mario; I want to be, like, dressed like that, except I don't have hair like his, um, obviously. 
And the day after that, November 1st, I'm going to a concert, the Maine, Cobra Starship, Boys Like Girls, A Rocket the Moon and similar. I don't really like Boys Like Girls, or I don't really listen to A Rocket to the Moon, but the Maine and Cobra Starship are amazing. I cannot wait to see them. Like, did you see that? I was, like, jumping like out of my seat, like, blaah. 
School has been okay, I don't really want to talk about school, because I think that's a boring subject to talk about. But, I will talk about choir; it is awesome, and the people are amazing. I'm the bass; I sing deep. 
In April, I get to go to New Orland's for a week and I get to see wicked for the first time. 
Um, you know how I was talking about being inspired on that one Saturday, when the camera was being stupid and not charged; well my friend, she goes to a public school which I obviously can't name on YouTube, and, um, she found a nerdfighter. And I desperately wanted to meet this person, because it'll be amazing; and I don't really know any other nerdfighters in my area. And, um, yeah. 
Uh, she also has a Quidditch team at her school. Argh, I'm jealous. Ah, we need that. If we had a Harry Potter club, that would be amazing; I would join. I would, like, nyah, but I've not even done with the books yet, um, I'm still on the fifth book, God I'm taking forever. Uh huh, that is all I have to say, I believe. Good bye.
