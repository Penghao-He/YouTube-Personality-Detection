Hello, XXXX. Are you poor? Do you want to donate to this project for I have some stuff, but you are unable to because you are a child, you don't have money, or you're just lazy? 
Well, here's the deal for you. With one click at the hungersite dot com which will be in the dubrydoo -- apparently over there. It's a new camera, give me a break. 
You will be able to donate this much rice; that's one point one cups to someone in need. And if you go to freerice dot com you can play a word game, language game, a math game for ten grains of rice per click. 
I know ten grains of rice isn't a lot, but this is about a hundred grains of rice, ten clicks. If ten of your friends did ten clicks, that would be a hundred grains of rice. 
If ten of their friends did ten clicks, that would be about a bagillion grains of rice. Math is just approximate. 
If you really wish you could help someone but you're poor, please go to these sites and I'll thank you. I'm not sure how, but I will. Don't worry. 
That was stupid. 
That's right, I do my own sound effects.
