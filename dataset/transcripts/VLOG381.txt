Hi. It's me again, the preacher from the Philippines. This is XXXX. I am a preacher. I went to public college. I uh, took a bunch of reports. And I have more than thirty six years of experience in preaching the words of God, and more so the bible as crusaders, pregenerali teacher, evangeliers. Head pastor. So I make sure that all of you that I know what I'm talking about. 
I appointed son, I agree, I believe, but you are the appointed son of Satan. 
The appointed son of God. 
The lord Jesus Christ and to know and believe and God raised him again from the dead, you will be saved.
