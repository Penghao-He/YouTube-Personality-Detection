Hey. What's up everybody. This is XXXX, Super thick mommy. Um, this is just a shout out video. The reason why I'm doing this video is because yesterday I reached forty thousand plus friends on MySpace, um, and I was super excited about that and very happy. It might be 'cause I have forty thousand friends. I mean, yeah, okay its cool I got forty thousand friends. But the fact that people are showing me love and, you know, appreciate what I do. Um, and the more people I get to get involved in the movement and, you know, follow my YouTube videos and, um, basically understand. Sorry about that. . Just basically understand that the reason why I'm doing this, yes I love modeling. Yes I love to take pictures. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I love it all. But I also love it when I get a message from another big girl who tells me, um, they look up to me and that they appreciate what I do for them, and, you know, that I'm an inspiration to them. That right there makes my day. The fact that somebody tells me that, that I can do that difference in their lives, wow. That's for me -- that for me right now is overwhelming. Just because I was at their spot in their shoes just about two years ago. And the fact that I can help another big girl appreciate herself and make herself feel good. That tops a lot right there. So that's why I do this video. I want to thank everybody for showing me love and for being there and -- like every step of the way. So, it's -- it's super exciting and, um, I'm just going to be doing more blogs, yeah, not video blogs, not vlogs. I saw people putting that on MySpace so now I know that they're called vlogs, there you go. So that's it. That's why I wanted to do this little thank you video, and, uh, just so that you guys know that I do appreciate every single comment, every photo comment, every message. And I'm, I'm super excited woah. I also wanted to basically say hi to all the big girls. Say hi to my girl, uh, Pantera. I love you girl, you're like, um, seriously, um, you're something else but I really do love you a lot. But -- so she's my girl. Check her out, she's on my number one spot on MySpace and check out her website, queensizedelight. com, um, and just everybody that's been there supporting me from day one. So, um, just I love you.
