Hey everybody, what's up? I have got my first Eclipse movie update for you. Very, very exciting. The very first image released from Eclipse is finally available in super, super, super high quality. You can click the link in the info to check it out. Zoom in on it; whatever you want to do. 
Um, now I do realize that this, uh, has been out for a few of weeks. I actually saw it in entertainment weekly, like, a month ago, but, um, you know, it was just, like, a picture in the magazine and you couldn't really do anything with that see it in. So, um, now, of course, it is available online in super high quality, like I said. 
Uh, it's kinda tough to, like, say what your opinion is on a picture, because there's not really a whole lot going on in the picture. But, um, I'm very glad to see the good meadow back from New Moon, ah, as compared to the not meadow from Twilight, so that is a plus. Let me know in the comments what you think about the photo; if you can make opinions about it, really. And, as soon as I hear anything else about Eclipse, I will let you guys know.
