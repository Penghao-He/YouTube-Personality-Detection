Hey, how's that? Okay, so I just finished telling how the story of my gender marker needing changed in court. I went to -- would you behave yourself? No, you're done. Are you done? Okay, so I take my signed order to the DMV to get my license changed, and I -- and I'm waiting in line and I'm, like, this could get fun. 
Of course, the most conservative, not so nice looking lady says, may I help the next person please? So, I go up and I give her the form I signed and filled out; and I'm, like, so okay, I don't need to renew my license, but I need to change my gender marker. And she just looks at me, like, huh? I said, I just got a court order; I just got my gender marker changed and need to change it; so I give her the order. 
She looks over it and says, I don't know if we can do this. I said, that order says that you have to. So, she's looking over it and she's, like, I just -- I don't know if we can do this. So, I read to her the part that says, it is ordered that all public offices change all documents blah, blah, blah to reflect the new gender, blah, blah, whatever, legal speak. I don't remember what the hell I wrote. And so, at this point she says, well, you know, I'm just not comfortable with this, I don't think I can do -- I'm not going to do this. So, I said, I need to speak to your manager. 
So, she -- me and then this other fantastically, pleasant looking individual comes up to me and she, like, says, what seems to be the problem? I said, well I got my gender marker changed this morning; and I asked her if she could change it for me; and she said that she doesn't feel it's ethically correct to do so. And so, I had to ask for you, and she looks at it and she's, like, well, you know, I just don't know how I feel about this; I don't think that I can do this either. And so, I grabbed the order and I said, this is a court signed order. It says it is ordered, and ordered is in bold print here. I didn't say that it was in bold print, but just looking at the document you can see its bold print. And so, I read it to her; she's, like, well I guess we have no choice, do we? I was, like, no, you don't. She tells the other lady, well go ahead and do it then. 
I love the way they get all shitty and snotty with me and print the thing out and hand it to me, and she's, like, here you go. And so, I signed it. She's, like, I need your left thumb print over here and your right thumb print over here and then she takes my picture. And I'm sure that I'm smiling, like, a fool in this picture. 
Because I mean not only did I just get my gender marker changed by myself, it kind of pleases me to force people to do things that they don't want to do in respect to this. I know it's wrong, but I can't help it. 
So, I get my, you know, paper ID. I have to wait, like, six to eight weeks for my photo ID. Yah. 
So, I -- you know, I stroll on over to Social Security Office and by stroll I mean get in my car and drive a mile or two and, you know, whatever. And so, the -- the lady called me, in Social Security and she was far more pleasant. She just asked for -- you know, I -- I told her what was up and I gave her the order and she was, like, okay, I need your ID. And so, I gave her my paper one and she was, like, do you have anything with the picture on? I said, here's my old one that still says female, and then she verified some information on me that they have. And she asked me if I need a new card and I say, no, because I still have my card; and it doesn't have a gender marker on it. She says, okay, have a nice day. And I'm, like, oh you too. 
So, I finished all that up and I'm super excited and then I had to go to work. Fail. But, yeah. So, I get off work and I go to a bar to celebrate with my friends. And they had all left, 'cause they all had big girl jobs and big boy jobs. So, I went to the bar tonight, because so more shit happened at work that's not so good, but that's for another story. 
So, yeah, I'm legally male. My driver's license and social is changed. I have to work out my passport and other such documentation, but yeah, life is good. And, I win. I'll catch you later. Bye.
