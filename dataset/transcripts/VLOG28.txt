I'm back. Hey guys. Sorry, I haven't made a video in a long time. It's just my computer is broke. You can tell by the graininess of this video, that I'm using my parents' computer. And I might have to do a lot of cuts if I make any videos until my computer is fixed, because this will only record one minute at a time. And if it records over that then the video and audio starts to go out of sync, and then it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. So, and by the way, I got a new look. Since we last met I have changed my whole look. I've decided to go from wearing just a plain T shirt and jeans to actually layering my T shirt, and a new hat. Yay. Yay to new hats. It gives me bad hat hair though. But it's a cool hat. Yay hats. So, this is just my saying I'm sorry it's taken me a long time to get this video up, and I might be back -- depends on how good my editing skills is. Skills is. My skills are depends on how, if I will make a video or not soon. I might. And, as you can see, I'm not in the best of locations to make a video, and I live with my parents, so they might also be a factor on whether or not I can make a video soon, so, yeah, I guess that's all. Goodbye for now. Wahaha. XXXX. Bye.
