Hey, just want to say Happy Halloween to all y'all. I just got nothing going on here so I'll probably be bored tonight. Unless you guys have ideas of stuff for me to do; like going to a party, you know, have fun. 
Um, stupid apartments, can't -- won't let us carve pumpkins and put them out front. Uh, that's what you get for living in Orange County, right? 
Uh, anyways, just want to say happy Halloween, have fun whatever you're doing. Don't break too many laws. If you're going to drink, don't drive. I know I'll probably be drinking, but I will not be driving. 
Uh, do what you want to do, have fun, be safe. That's the key; be safe. 
Uh, let me know what you did. Uh, I definitely want to know what you guys did for Halloween. 
Uh, so, yeah.
