So on the internet, I've always been really open about myself, my thoughts, my personality. I don't let any of it -- I don't hold any of it back, most of the time, and that usually works out pretty well for me. But it's gotten to a point where I'm starting to question. Uh, not question myself but question how I act on the internet. Does that make any sense? 
Um, Facebook. Facebook has basically ruined everything for me. MySpace did and didn't. It's much bigger with Facebook, because with Facebook, there are people that watch me on Facebook that -- or that I'm friends with on Facebook, I guess -- that I knew when I was in, like, high school and some of them are my teachers from high school, who really aren't that much young -- that much older than me, actually. 
But I went to a Christian school, and back when I went to that school, I was really quiet. I was shy. I was withdrawn. I didn't really take good care of myself. I would -- I was kind of a slob, and uh, so, a lot of people when they think back to me they probably have that kind of vision in their head and that's not who I am anymore. 
I am not quiet, I am not a prude. I am -- I still consider myself a good person. I still -- I'm still very spiritual. I still love God, but I have a potty mouth and I like bad things, and I think I'm okay with that. But -- but -- but -- I -- I originally connected my Facebook to my Twitter because my -- you know, I was never updating my Facebook and I thought the only way I could really update my Facebook was if I connected it to Twitter. 
But I'm kind of paranoid now. I'm kind of -- sometimes I -- I sensor myself. I tone down the potty mouth, and I -- I tone down the really stupid shit, because I'm thinking, oh man, those people from all those years ago, they're gonna read that and they're gonna think what the -- what the holy hand happened to her. 
And -- and I hate feeling, like, I have to do that. And apparently it's the same, like, the same way with employers. Now, like, anyone looks up my name, they'll see all the stupid shit I do, and probably they won't have the best impression. 
But then the question then becomes, do I need to sensor myself for these people? To be considered good enough for these people? Um, I don't think so, I don't think I should have to. But the question is still there and -- and so I'm constantly questioning myself, should I say that, should I say the F word, should I say hell, should I say damn, will that offend somebody, and have -- make them think less of me? And, why should I fucking care? It's the fucking internet. If you can't handle it, get off the fucking internet. 
I'm sorry. I'm really distracted. It's snowing outside. It's Houston; it's snowing outside. It's kinda freaking me out. Um, but yeah! Um, so, what would you do? Would you try to sensor yourself to make -- because I mean, there's all this shit I do. There's my blogs that I do that I -- I plainly say, my name is XXXX, hi, how are you doing? You know, all of my comics, my really stupid, stupid comics have my name on them. All the stupid phantom stuff I do, like, the Nintendo stuff, the video game music, it's all right there with my name on it, and anyone who looks up XXXX is going to see this dork. 
So should I hold that back, or should I just be fucking honest? And I've always felt that honesty was the best policy when it came to this kind of stuff, but, do -- should I clean up my internet image and keep the F words, and whatever else behind some kind of lock so only certain people can read them? 
But I hate that. I hate the thought of not freely expressing myself. So, there you have it. 
Yeah. Let's go look the snow.
