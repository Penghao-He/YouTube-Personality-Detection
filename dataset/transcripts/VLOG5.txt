Doing a standard re tweet themed, so web two point zero, and you guys know how I roll, I'm all three point zero up in here. Anyway, I got a message about CD's, umm, she, here I -- I -- you know I finally hear at three forty seven A. M. , I got to watch her Actions Talk, umm, episode -- I don't know what to call it -- like, interview? It's on Actions Talk about her website, sohobiztube. 
So, I'm -- I'm throwing this on the twitter, and the link to her interview is uh, you're on the YouTube right now, and the link is right there. But I wanted to say a -- a few things about CD. CD is the person who saw me speak one day and put me on the cover of her magazine here. That I am, looking all -- looking all something. Um, and she's putting together this website, sohobiztube, which a -- whose goal I guess is to be -- she says the YouTube for businesses, but I -- you know, I look forward to umm, businesses getting schooled in the arts of picking up a little, uh, digital camera like I have here, and running around their business like, hey, look at my business, look at my business, and then putting it on the internet. That'll be, that'll be awesome, you gotta have more of that. 
Oh here, I have my old broken camera. See businesses, you can take your camera, and then you can record like this, and then you can put it on sohobiztube, and connect with other elite business ninjas on the interwebs. Ok the -- I -- anyway - the, the video is actually good. There's some cool, insightful stuff in there. It's ten minutes, which at, you know, at first, you know for us A. D. H. D. internet people you're like oh no, but, it's worth sitting down through it and watching it. 
And I'm going to, uh, release you from this, uh, uh, video experience, and uh, go -- go check her out. I'll put her twitters and my twitters and the link to the video over there. And check out the other Actions Talk videos if you're into being an entrepreneur and being up at three A. M. , and having your house look like that, you know what I'm saying? Ok, I'm good, I -- huh -- duh -- huh, time to go to sleep.
