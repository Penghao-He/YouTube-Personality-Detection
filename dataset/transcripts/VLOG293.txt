I haven't this much writing this week because I just haven't been motivated, and I noticed that a lot of my friends that were doing it haven't really been either so this poem is for them, Christine, Kara, Paige and Kaitlin , and for myself. 
The words won't come. Minutes and hours and days of staring at the blank sheet, and yet nothing comes to mind. What should they say? What should they do? You have no idea. How could you? You don't know yourself what to do or what to say, when you feel lost, when you feel empty. What's left to give, when you've already taken everything you have and already put it in? There's nothing left to do or say, you have nothing. 
And in reading that, I just realized that it's kind of about the ChartJackers' Single which is out today. It makes me happy. I 'm going to go buy that soon, and I think everybody should too. Link in the sidebar. And hopefully next week will go better. I'm going to go finish reading Mother Night. I realize that I'm way behind in my fifty book challenge, um. That's like my thirty eighth book. I have, like, eight weeks to read twelve books. So, procrastination strikes again.
