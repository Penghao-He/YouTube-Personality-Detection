Hello. I know that this is really close and I know that my skin is the same color as the white closet door behind me but, you know, that's just how is it, um, on a good day so, let's just get started. 
Band is pretty much taking up all of my time. There's really nothing I can do about it. And I promise that I will post more videos and get more involved in the -- once band's over which is going to be November first. It's the first day that I won't have any band things to do in the future. It's kind of weird thinking about it because band has been such a big part of my life for the past four -- three years and, well, this one too, but -- I had my last first competition on Saturday and it didn't really go as planned. We didn't march because the field was really muddy so it was -- it was kind of hard to get all sentimental about it, but it was nice. 
Um, it's really weird just thinking about growing up. And I'm not necessarily one of the people who want to grow up. I don't think that growing up is a good thing necessarily. I don't think that my life is going to magically get better once I am grown up. Besides, what does grown up mean anyway? 
Um, so I finished the Hunger and Catching Fire and I have to say, they're the most beautiful, most intense books that I have ever read apart from Harry Potter and they are definitely on my favorites list. And right now I'm trying to finish off The Catcher in the Rye and Harry Potter's Should've Died, by the lovely mugglenut. com and, um, I'm reading Grindle for school and I really want to read a Sigmund Freud biography so if you know of any super good ones then I would love for you to tell me which one I should read. And, um, I've got to read the Iliad and the Odyssey. 
I'm not really sure if I like this really zero close up thing but I wasn't really liking the really far away thing either. I'm seriously thinking about getting my hair cut really short, like I think it would be adorable and I really kind of want to. And I don't really have anything else to say, but fall break is next week and I'm really not all that excited because it just means that I have to do my college applications because I've been putting them off. And, um, I'm applying to Vanderbilt which is in Tennessee which is where I live and I'm really nervous about it because I kind of don't think I'll get in. I -- I would love to go there but it would be a lot easier just to go to my local college. And just it would be a lot cheaper and I would be around friends but would it be as good of an education? No it wouldn't, but I'm not really sure if sixty thousand dollars of debt is gonna be worth it all. I don't know. I'm just thinking. 
Anyways, I've got a lot of homework to do, a lot I've procrastinated on by making like ten versions of this video but I'm going to need to finally just stop making different versions and host this one. So I'm going to go and I promise once band's over, I will become more involved in YouTube and I promise that maybe one day, I'll actually smile on a video. I know I've been kind of detached and like emotionless, at least my expression. So that's that and I'll see you guys later. Okay, bye.
