Hey, what's up? Whatchya doing? I'm not doing anything, and it's Friday. And I should be doing, like, everything today 'cause I have no work tomorrow. It's, like, the beginning of the weekend, and no school or anything tomorrow. But I have nothing to do, really. 
Because I can't afford to drive to see my friends, so I'm kinda like stuck here. And it's really lame. I have nothing to do. So I decided to make a YouTube video and, um, it's kinda a pointless one, so I'm really sorry. 
But I -- I didn't realize that, um, on my eighteenth birthday I got myself a present and I never showed you. It's kind of, um, not showing up as much as it was, but, um, this is it. Yep. It says, "The Used", and it's, like, a copy off of, um, Brandon , a drummer from The Used -- the old drummer from The Used. He had the same tattoo, so I -- I had to copy it. 
Yeah, yeah, if I had a scooter -- which is what I want, or a moped -- uh, it would, like, fix everything. Even though it's, like, freezing outside right now, I'd still take my scooter out and go to wherever the fuck I want, because I don't want to be here right now. I want to be with friends and, um -- but I can't afford to drive that far. It really sucks. But a scooter would, like, make everything better. 
So. I don't even have, like, people to talk to online, right now. Because normally I do. Normally I'm talking to people and, uh, I'm not. Like, they're not on, so I'm really bored. I have nothing to do. My sister's asleep. Would somebody entertain me? This camera's not working. Doesn't, like, I don't know -- talking to a camera doesn't really entertain me all that much. Believe it or not. Uh, . Oh yeah, fucking gag me with a spoon, Jesus Christ. This video is retarded. 
Cat? Tiger? I don't know if you've seen my cat, Tiger. He's, uh, the one with the flat face. You know, he's a Himalayan -- I don't. I don't even know if you've seen him before. But, uh, like, he's dying. It's a happy subject. He has bone cancer, and it's, like, this lump on his back is pretty gross. And, uh, I asked my mom if I could have a cat, a brand new kitten, because I really want a kitten, like, really bad. And she said not 'til Tiger dies. How fucking morbid is that? Yeah, I had to share that. 
Oh my God, I have to tell you. We -- I'm really scared that I'm repeating a story that I've already told you, but, um, I work at a bookstore right next to PetCo. And, at PetCo, they had, um, two lizards -- a male and a female -- escape. And they laid eggs somewhere, but they don't really know where. And randomly, we got, like, this little baby lizard in our toilet. And we didn't know there was, like, two lizards escaped and they're -- were hatching eggs. It was the weirdest thing, because there was just a baby lizard in our toilet. Like, what the fuck? So, um, my co worker grabbed it out of the toilet and went over to PetCo and bought a cage at her -- um, aquarium -- and, like, a heat rock and stuff. And now the lizard's name is Toilet. Yeah, that's my story. 
Oh, but I have more work stories. Um, fuck. I don't know if I said this or not. I'm really sorry if I'm repeating stuff. Um, but one day, uh, my manager walked into the store and, like, walked to the back and somebody had, like, tried to pry open the office, which is where we keep, like, all the money. That's where the safe is and stuff. And, uh, like, one of the back doors had been opened and, so somebody was in there at some point in time, hiding in there when uh, me and my co worker, Ashley, were closing. Like, somebody hid in the store and we locked them in and then they tried to break in and steal money. Like, what the fuck? And we figured it was probably in the bathroom, but -- that's kind of a scary thought, is it not? Like, somebody was hiding in there when I closed the store. 
Damn it, I keep having, like, random stuff to talk about. But, um, people like to mention how I, like, rock back and forth, or I -- I close part of my mouth or something when I -- when I'm talking to the camera. It's all 'cause I'm really fucking shy. That's all. And I don't know; I am a little bit more calm today. My Mom's not here, so I don't have to worry about like waking her up or anything. But, uh, I'm just really pretty shy. I'm surprised that I don't stutter throughout my videos, because when I get nervous, I usually do. So, um, you know about that part, but, I mean, I mumble and I close part of my mouth sometimes and just like move around a whole lot. And sometimes my hands are roaming crazy, and I'm just, like, laughing at myself the entire time. So, I just want you guys to know that I'm -- I'm really fucking shy. 
Like, I -- I'm scared to call people. I've paid my sister to make phone calls for me. I -- I can't go to, like, a gas station and talk to the person behind the counter for, like, more than like, a second. I can say like, thanks, and that's about it. I can't, like, ever remember if I'm trying to buy gas and I can't pre pay, I never, like, remember what pump I'm even at, and, like, how much money I'm putting in. Like, it's, yeah. 
And I say like a lot. I know you've probably really noticed that way too much, but, um, yeah. Um, I'm -- I'm sorry about that part. Can't really help it. But, uh, it -- it's all just 'cause I'm -- I'm really shy. 
Like, I basically went through, like, I don't know, all of middle school almost not even talking. So I'm also a major dork and I can't believe I just admitted that I, like, didn't talk to people. I mean, I did occasionally, but, um, there were definitely some days when I, like, almost go the entire day without talking. 
Now I'm just a really fucking Emo and weird. I'm a little better now. Um, I talk to cameras. I just made myself pretty much, like, die right now. Breathe. All right. 
Oh my God. Shitty video number one thousand six. 
The end.
