Hello, YouTubers. Um, in my last video I actually had used the music from a local band. I figured I'd just, um, give you a little bit more detail on it. It's a band called Sproll. It's actually a band from my home town. Um, I actually know one of the members in the band who I did work with 'til recently. 
Um, the music is awesome as you already heard. Um, the song in particular which was um, Eyes have Spoken is on disc which their first EP called Soft Science. 
Um, now they have another follow up album called Radio that just came out. Um, you can get information at www dot sproll dot ca or at maplemusic dot com. You can actually order the CDs from there. 
Um, just we're gonna give you a little explanation on that music and uh, but you should go and check them out, they're really awesome. I haven't actually had the chance to see them live yet. I keep missing their shows so I'm hoping that I will get to see the next show so I promise, Glen , I will make it to your next show. 
Um, there it is, that's it. I just figured I would share that with you.
