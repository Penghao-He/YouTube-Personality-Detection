So, I'm vlogging. I'm vlogging at my boyfriend's house. Oh my God --
What are you doing? 
Vlogging. 
Vlogging? 
. Vlogging. 
In my room? 
So, I totally haven't made a video, in like, a month because I've been at school and school is hectic. 
What? What ? 
So yeah, so I haven't made a video in like a month and I feel really awkward with you standing there. This is weird. So, yeah. 
I love you. 
I love you too. I'll be down in a minute. So yeah, that's my boyfriend, that's XXXX. That was him. Um, so my classes are ridiculous. They like make me want to cry and um, yeah. I've just been having a really hard time. So like, if any of you are like really really smart when it comes to like -- I don't even know. Like science or -- or math, can you like help me out, 'cause I'm having issues in my Bio Two and my Math class. So -- oh, where'd it go? Babe? Babe?

Hi.

Are you still recording? 
Yes. 
Why?

What? 
Oh. Whoa, big head. 
Thanks. 
Woooo. Woooo.

Did you know that is our favorite place to be?

'Cause my bed is bigger. 
Yeah. 
We're awkward. 
Nah, there's gotta be far more awkward people than that. I just did it. 
Do it again. All right, so I'm gonna get him out of the frame. 'Cause I'm more important. And um, I'm going to try to make a video later, more serious than an update vlog. But guys, I just wanted to do an update vlog, so --
