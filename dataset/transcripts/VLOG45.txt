Hi, it's XXXX I just got back from my trip this weekend. I feel so bad, okay, so I come home and first of all my camera bag did arrive fine but, yeah. I was worried -- I was getting this thing from Amazon Vine and um, somebody would steal it, like, if they would steal a book on Humanor, if they would steal a ukulele why wouldn't they steal a camera bag? The thing keeps -- this bag thing is bigger than my suitcase I'm, like, what I'm suppose to put ten cameras in it what? What? I don't know. 
I have, like, sort of a professional grade digital camera that I got last year 'cause I'm crazy, I don't know and some different lenses for it and stuff but I'm, like, I could put my camera and all the lenses and, like, my lunch for the next week in it and probably my cat, it's China kitty. 
Anyway I feel -- so I get the package and then of course I come home to my cats and, like, I'm usually gone for, for two nights in a row and I feel so bad that I'm not there in that sort of that middle day to, like, give them some extra moist food and stuff and I feel like -- I feel like um, she, like -- she wants the attention but she's-- she's, like, I don't know, she's extra, extra, she's extra claws when I -- when she's mad at me and I think she's mad. 
And she's so skinny. Like, I really noticed it when I have been gone for two nights and when I come back and I swear she's lost another, like, half an ounce or something which for her it's a lot. Yeah so I have a little China kitty here and she's kinda being sweet and she's kinda being mean. I think she's mad, but isn't she cute? Aww, she doesn't like that, very sad. 
Yeah, so we went to this wedding. I think I had to do another, like, ten more things to do when you're broke video 'cause I thought of some more, yeah, but I don't know if some of those things are good. Like, I was talking about weddings. I was talking about, um, you know, you can go to a wedding and you get free food and everything, but you know my boyfriend and I are vegans so we were really lucky because we know the mother of the bride and she was really sweet and she said, oh I'm going -- ah she said just, like, the day before the wedding, uh, let me try to get you um, the beef entrée without the beef 'cause then you're going to get, like, potatoes and vegetables and stuff where there was a pasta entrée that was, like, cheese lasagna or something and so we couldn't eat that. And she actually remembered to do it so it was awesome, but then it was, like, hey -- hey no fighting, no fighting. Come here Rodney , come here. Come here because you're so cute and we want to sit together and we don't want to fight with China. Oh you're so warm, so cuddly, so cute. Yeah, he's, like, so excited, yeah. We're excited Rodney, we're excited. 
And um, yeah, so uh, she managed to switch it but we drank maybe a lot of, wine probably because we were a little bored. No, I mean, it was a great wedding it was like, this fairytale Cinderella kind of wedding really nice, but just, like, just boring enough to drink a little too much wine, maybe and that's fine to do once in a while, I guess, unless you don't have very much food. So when you just, like, have a few vegetables and a couple pieces of roasted potato, like, you haven't really had that much to eat. 
So after the wedding we ended up going to Safeway and trying to find some vegan friendly food. And this is the bad part because you see, I was vegetarian for twenty years and I did spend some time along time ago being vegan too and I read food labels like a maniac. So if you want to know vegan junk food? Like, I can tell you vegan junk food and part of our reason for eating vegan is to eat healthy. So what good is it to know what junk foods are vegan? Like, you know what kind of cookies are vegan or whatever? It doesn't do you any good. So we went -- we got a bunch of crap. We went and got a bunch of crap, yeah. 
So um, yeah, my point is what good does it do to go to a wedding and, you know, like, you're getting free food at the wedding, but then you're vegan. Uh, yeah, it doesn't -- doesn't do much good. 
And then for just total humiliation, like, I brought this dress to wear, really nice dress and um, I saw that It was too small for me yeah because I am too fat. I was too fat to wear that dress. So we went to an outlet mall and my boyfriend bought me a new dress which looked quite similar to the old dress only it was a size larger and not as nice. It wasn't as nice of a dress. It was very similar. It was almost the same only not as nice and -- and with and ugly neckline but um, he bought me this dress and a purse. Actually the purse is really nice and now I wish that it wasn't in my luggage because I would show you the purse is awesome. So I totally scored this cool dressy purse even though my video camera doesn't fit in it very well. So that's not good but , like, look China stole my spot, oh so sad, yeah. 
So humiliating dress didn't fit, had to get a new one, wasn't quite as nice and my boyfriend is, like, you have to wear nylons because -- or stockings whatever because they look nice, they look so elegant and whatever and I'm, like, well they're not comfortable and I'm already wearing body suit. I have to wear the nylons and put the body suit over it and I'm, like, not comfortable. And he's, like, sometimes to look really good, you have to suffer a little bit. 
And I was thinking of my mom 'cause I don't know what she used to be doing. Like, if my grandmother used to be doing something to her hair or whatever it was and my mom would complain and -- and my grandmother would say, well you have to suffer to be beautiful. My mom would say, well I don't want to be beautiful. And, um yeah, it made me think of that. But uh, it made me many things, it made me think of that but uh, I guess it is all a matter of balances. 
But then you look around and you see people that look very nice that maybe aren't wearing nylons and you're, like -- you're thinking, like, I think he just, you just don't have to wear them in California or something. What the heck? why am I wearing these? Silly, I don't know. I'm not sure if I agree with, like, the whole you have to wear nylons thing ever in California. I think there should be a law passed against it. I would totally vote in favor of the no nylons no stocking -- well stockings are okay. But no nylons, no nylons. 
But we discovered this awesome noodle bar and we're, like, now we want to check out every noodle bar in the Bay Area 'cause we're, like, noodle bars rule. And we went there twice and um, what else? We went to Lodi on the way to Sacramento and we went to Load Eye again on the way back and uh, on the way back was really cool because the second winery we went to the owner of the winery was there and he was, just, like, a total wine geek and he was, like, you know, I guess he though we were pretty cool so he was going -- running in the back and, like, getting barrel samples out and bringing out for us to taste and stuff. And it was just -- and the wine was good too so that was awesome. 
And um, yeah, oh, oh we went to Shevi's tonight. Shevi's, what the heck I don't even know why we pick Shevi's. I had, like, guacamole which at least they make their own guacamole from scratch right at your table; that's kinda cool. Guacamole, corn tortillas, which I like except that the ones my boyfriend make are, like, a hundred times better and um, beans -- black beans that's what I had, and -- oh, like, a margarita the size of my head, like, gra -- grande, a grande margarita. Way too big, actually I didn't even finish it. Yeah, and uh, yeah. 
And I have really been perfecting the technique of keeping my boyfriend awake when he's driving because I'm never driving on trips. He's the one doing the driving. But I am, like, the master. I just keep him awake. Ah yeah, currently -- I need more, better songs on my iPod Nano though now that we have the cord to plug that into his -- his car. If we both sing along to songs on -- on there it uh, it really keeps us awake. It makes the time go really fast. I'm sure we sound completely ridiculous, but it's fun right? Yeah so, anyway. 
Now we're looking forward to Halloween. We've got Halloween coming up and we are totally not ready for it and I'm freaking out. I don't know about him, but I'm panicking. I'm panicking -- hu -- hu -- hu -- and I think that I might have volunteered to spend the day at his house putting up Halloween decorations. I mean that's cool, you know. 
Like, we had to take a client of his out to dinner and then the next night -- or no, his business partner and then the next night his accountant or vice versa and I said, well maybe in between I could stay at your house and put up Halloween decorations, but I thing that means that I actually signed up to hangout with his mother all day because she lives there and I'm, like, oh no, are you serious? 
Yeah, so that's going to be my week.
