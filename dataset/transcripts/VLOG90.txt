Ladies and gentleman, robots. This blog is lastly in response to an article posted on facebook. com about a toddler sized robot that has learning capabilities that within two years will be similar to that of a two year old child. The link is in the sidebar. 
This robot was designed to learn just like a human. It looks like a human, kinda; it talks like a human, kinda; and apparently it can even walk like a human. A quote from the article, which the company that built the robot might consider as promotional material is, it's not human, but it is paying attention, or maybe not. 
This article doesn't just deal with this creepy two year old robochild folk, it also talks about the use of robots in modern society. A few of the uses that it cites for robots are a talking office receptionist, a security guard, a primary school teacher. These are all examples of robots that have actually been built and used. A primary school teacher? Really? There are robots that can strut catwalks and assist elderly people who are living alone. 
Now the first thing I have to ask, in a global recession, when there are so many more jobs needed than have been in recent history, do we really want to be thinking about replacing human workforce with cold mechanical machines? The article does close with a paragraph that might explain my reaction to it --
ï»¿The transfiguring metallic assassins from the future aside, there's something that unnerves me about an old man alone in a house with something that runs on batteries.
