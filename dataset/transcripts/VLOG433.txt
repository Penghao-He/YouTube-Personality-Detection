Hello there. There is a slim chance you are watching this video because you saw it featured on one of my channels or maybe you're subscribed and you saw it in your subscriptions. There is a very slim chance that you just stumbled on it. Or maybe you found it in a related search or in someone's favorites. 
But most likely you are watching this video because it was sent to you as an attachment and a personal message on YouTube. Ahh! Some of you may be angry about that; some of you may even call me a spammer. When I put up a video, I typically share it out once, and then I let it go its own way. I don't put pressure on people to watch my videos. 
If you felt pressure to watch this video because I sent it to you in a personal message, that was not my intention. I put up videos for people to see whenever they have the time to. They're not going anywhere. Because of the number of contacts I have, for me to get to all of their videos would be impossible, so I can't expect everyone to come see mine. They're there for whenever someone wants to come and watch them. 
I didn't gain five thousand subscribers on my main channel by just putting up my videos and letting them go either. I do share them out once, and I think that is reasonable. 
There are three types of people on YouTube. 
﻿Overall this is a video sharing website. That is what YouTube is all about. If you don't like receiving videos at all from people, then you should get off of YouTube, go to Myspace, go to Facebook. Those sites are centered around messages and comments and blogs. It's not centered around videos. Now I don't know about Facebook but I know that at Myspace you cannot load videos which you can embed, and you can send out emails to your friends or your family. It's not centered around videos so you won't be getting them all the time. I suggest you go over there. 
Having my inbox so full all the time with all the stuff, it's very hard for me to get my important messages. 
There is a simple solution to that. Stop using YouTube as your personal messaging centre. Exchange email addresses. Exchange instant messengers with the people that you would be receiving these important messages from. The other thing to do if you just must be on YouTube but you don't want videos, is put your channel on friend lock. Go into your accounts settings, lock your channels so only friends can message you, and then when you get friend invites, do not accept them. Just ignore them. Some people here think that the label friend on YouTube means friend like good buddy, pal. If you want to make it that you can, nobody's gonna stop you. But that's not YouTube's intention of that label, friend. When you get a friend invite, you get a notification that says, friend invitation. So and so would like to share videos with you. It doesn't say that so and so wants to get to know you personally and establish a one on one emotional connection with you. When you get one of these friend invites, you just might think to yourself, well so and so is sending this invitation just because they want to send me videos. Well, yeah. Once again this is YouTube, it's a video sharing site. The whole idea is to send a friend invite to exchange videos with, to see if you like the videos that they're sending you, to see if they like the videos you send them and maybe if you like them that much you might subscribe to each other. Here's a little clue. If you don't like their videos you don't have to subscribe. But if you have friend lock on your channel and you don't want them sending videos to you any more -- it's a secret. All you do is remove them as a friend. 
And then they can't send you videos any more. It's as simple as that. And that's all I have to say. And you know that if, uh, this video was sent to you and I hope that it didn't bother you too much. But in case it did, well you know what to do about it. 
Thanks for your time, and keep trying out your videos. 
﻿It's related to your videos; but it is not spam. Now, just because doing this is not spam, doesn't mean that it can't be abused. Every single day, my inbox is flooded with hundreds of personal messages with videos attached to them. Some people send me the same video three times a day. Some people will send me a few different videos every single day. Some people will send me one video every single day. But, I don't say anything to them. I accept it, because I'm a video watcher and a video maker. And I'm serious about the videos I make. I want people to watch my videos. So, by me allowing people to send their videos to me, I expect that they can't get mad at me for sending them videos. I don't send many personal messages. You might get one from me, I don't know, once every other week, maybe. If that, maybe a whole month will go by and you won't even get anything from me with the exception of this time, because you know I just couldn't resist but to send this message out through a personal message. So, I get my inbox flooded with all this stuff. I try to send one message to people and I get a lot of heat from it and that's crap. I put up with all this; I try to send out one video. I got people calling me a spammer. Doing this reasonably is not spam and don't let anybody ever tell you other--.
