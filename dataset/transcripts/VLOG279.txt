Hey guys, it's me. I've made a video in a long time and that's why I'm making it right now. I was about to say right F'ing now and I was like no need to swear, I never swear much, so I don't know why I would swear. 
So, some news. I'm going to Beyoncé again, uh, twice, because I have two tickets. I'm going to Beyoncé again, yeah twice. So, you know, Beyoncé and me are best friends, you know, best friends. So much better camera, so you'll get to see my face in high definition. I know. 
Um, other news, other news, America opened in Dublin, so I got this shmeck , aha, a new one, in a different color and I had to actually pay for them unlike who's just is like, oh, I got send me, ah, seventy two random assorted items of clothing maybe or maybe not because I don't have half a million subscribers. Whatever. 
Anyway, So I just finished reading a book and I don't normally say -- I read a few books. I went on holidays as you know, and I'm quite tanned if you noticed that, but anyway I read a few books. I read these two books in particular. Um, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, uh, which is quite wonderful. Um, and it's all written in like, letters and it's really good. 
And this book here it's called Terrorist and it's by, you know, the late and great, John Updike. It's a -- you know, all of his books are magnificent books. Um, and that's the books I've been reading. Um, I'm trying to think if there is anything else I can talk about which there is nothing really. 
I got a Dolce and Gabbana shirt which was like the highlight of the last month. 
Oh, I dressed up as Beyoncé. If you're following me on daily booth, you'll know that I dressed up as Beyoncé for a costume, um, party. Today, yeah, I'll put a link in the -- in the sidebar, the side bar. I think I just pointed the wrong way; can't remember. Um, yeah, I won best dressed, I got -- I got a tenner, I think, 'cause it was the only win, yeah, so, you know, why not? You know, money is good. 
Um, I'm trying to think of something else I can talk about. Um, nope. Okay, so this seems like a good natural end to the video. Uh, and before we end it I'm just looking around my room in the hopes that I see something that inspires me. I showed you that I got Murder She Wrote, but I don't know what to say about that. 
Um, okay, I'll be seeing you then. Bye.
