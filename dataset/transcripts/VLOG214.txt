This is my flute, um. If you look really close you can see that girl with glasses. I'm hardcore, you know, doing all that flute playing and stuff. Maya lenses camera. Such crap. I mean, it's -- it's the video -- it's in QuickTime. That's why I got a new one; it's a Cannon Powershot A five -- six E -- AI six E. It's like, top of the market, you know? It has four optical zoom and seven point one megapixels -- I mean, that's really good. And it has video and AVI so I can upload videos up to here. 
I am so cool. I'm failing math. Oh my gosh, it's -- it's, oh, wow. Gollum girls, they're pimping. All the chicks think I'm now bad. Ah, oh my gosh, it was so painful. They -- they like, put me in this dental chair, I'm like, why can't you just tinfoil on my teeth? They said, no, we can't do that, ugh, ugh, and I said, fuck this. And so, I just got stuck in my mouth. I'm not exactly stable, yet. Is -- is this a cut, on the inside of my mouth, oh my gosh, oh no, oh no. 
You know, I'm just gonna go bang some chick, okay? Caress my puss. Oh my gosh the fucking noises. Let's focus. Oh my gosh. They're making a Ghost Buster game. Oh my gosh, oh, it's just so -- just so cool. I'm all cool. I have a game cube. Game what color. Super Mario Brothers. Yeah. 
Oh my gosh, I didn't shave my legs last night. I just need to chill. I have nice legs, and now they look ugly. I'll have to wear full length jeans. I never do that. I always wear shorts. On a brighter note, I got a new boyfriend. His name is Brad. Two hundred forty seventh boyfriend I've had. He's also the two hunted ad fifty seventh brad I've dated. Oh my gosh, I haven't put on makeup in half an hour. Oh, I look like crap. Oh.
