Hi. Today was so awesome aside from the rain. England -- people from America, seriously, listen to me. Don't come to England if you don't like rain. 
Where am I in my bedroom which is kind of like a box. I live in a cardboard box. It's pretty fun. 
Of how -- how me and Sophie were in town and she made a whole list -- I remember 'cause she was telling me like, 20 times in a row. She needed some nail stuff, I would say yeah, okay. Then she needed some knit gloves, then she needed trousers, then she needed hand sanitizer. 
Everyone is out there buying them like -- so they're buying them, just because they're scared of swine flu. Swine flu is basically another bird flu and how many people -- only a couple of people died from bird flu, right? So, it's the same kinda thing, but with pigs. Which I don't get. It's a load of bullshit. 
She went and bought one and she was, like, I don't know what one to get, I really seriously don't. I'm like, just get a freaking one. She's like, no I don't want one that smells like alcohol. I'm like, if it has alcohol in it, let me drink it, 'cause that would be cool. That is my new dare. I will get hand sanitizer and drink it, even though I might be puking. 
Anyways, so like, so we find like, a whole rack of them. There was like, yellow ones, green ones, blue ones, and white ones. And they hand like, four different colors. 
I cut my finger today. Oh my God, that one has a penguin on it, okay? I was like, penguins, I love penguins. Who doesn't? They're so cute and adorable. I could just pick one up and eat one. Like, oh, I'll pick up that one. 
Then she picked up a dolphin one, just like they have like, little pictures on them. Like, what's wrong with dolphins? I'm like --
not animals. Animals do it for, like, the circle -- the circle of life, I was like, yeah, just don't buy it. She was, like, fair point. I'm not going to buy it, hand sanitizer with, like, a shaggy thing on it. It's like putting some -- it's like putting a human on hand sanitizers with a ball, so it makes it even worse, so that the dog thing looks like a penis and the ball looks like balls, so it's like -- it's like penis about hand sanitizers. 
Wow , but that was pretty funny, that was a pretty fun day. Getting soaking wet and walking home and then I found my mum and then she gave me a bus fare home. 
So therefore your hands smell like sanitizer smells like, that would be pretty cool. If you actually have one, let me know what it actually smells like, 'cause I actually want to, like, try them and if I find the right one, I would drink it, I would drink that God damn sanitizer.
