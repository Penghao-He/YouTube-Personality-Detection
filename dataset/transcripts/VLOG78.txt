Okay, so when you're pregnant, basically, your hormones, like, makes you go certifiably insane. But they also make you do something else that's really kind of cool, because they make your hair and nails grow and your skin glow and everything looks great. And then after you have the baby your hormones, like, go crazy again and basically what happens is, um, your hair starts falling out, because your hair doesn't really fall out when you're pregnant, so it just kind of all falls out at once. 
And well, I was vacuuming the other day and I wondering why the vacuum wasn't really working very well and I tipped it over and you will not believe this, but this is what I cut out of the bottom of the vacuum. Now, you can see that this, like, matches my hair, right? This is disgusting. I, like, shed more than a pet. Um, and yeah, this is other, like, carpet and fiber in here, does not come off my head by the way. So um, yeah, this is really gross I'm even showing you guys this, but this -- I had to cut all of this hair out from -- from the bottom of the vacuum. This is, like, enough to make a wig for a small child. 
She's just like mummy, she loves wigs. See, she likes it. I'm a little baby with the wig boop boop .
