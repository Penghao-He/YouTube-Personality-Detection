Hiya! Today's vlog is brought to you by echo, echo, echo, echooo. See how the only purpose why I'm making this video is, because I recorded something earlier just to try it. Um, if you could hear the echo in this room through the camera or through the camera and yes you can. 
And I think that it's funny, because this is the room where I always recorded my videos when I was at my dad's; you know, the one with the red chair. There's no red chair anymore, because some -- that -- the entire room is empty. It's empty and it's dirty, because, um, behind all the furniture there is dirt. And I don't know how old that dirt is, but it's probably, probably old and disgusting. 
Let me show you what I mean. I'm going to give you a three hundred and sixty of my empty room. Isn't that exciting? I know, I know, yeah, I see. Um, okay. So, there it starts; wall, there, urr, ah, ah, there, eww, eww, ich, my nails, eww, gross. Okay, moving on; my door, um, a coke bottle I forgot to sweep up. And eww, look at that, eww, disgusting. Am -- Am I pointing? I don't -- I can't see the screen. I don't know, but eww, eww. 
Okay, so I'm just gonna do this. I have no idea what I'll find in the house, but I'm sure you can see that is disgustingly dirty. And, there, there, there, see that? Eww, eww, eww eww, there, oh, yuck, there you see that, ah. Gross, gross, err, anyway, um, yeah that was my room, hah exiting. Oh, and if I didn't realize that I'm lying on the floor. And the floor is just as dirty as the walls, but then again my toes are dirty from throwing all that stuff out and worn from carrying boxes that seem to be, like, I don't know, just as heavy as me. And, it's just my back does not feel too cheerful, let me tell you that. 
Anyway, ah, so that's the only purpose why I am making this video, because I thought that it was funny to have such an echo in a room that used to be not echoey at all. And the same echo always reminds me of Mr. Echo, um, yeah. I don't know what I'm saying now. I just thought that I'd make a video and I like the color of my socks and the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end .
