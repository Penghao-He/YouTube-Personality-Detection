Merry Christmas. Oh, my God. Yeah, it's finally here, it's finally here! Woo! 
Um, I hope you're all having a good one. I don't know what my favorite present is, um; probably, it'd have to be out of the stationary set; the pair of slippers I got; the pajama one suit or the tea cup. 
I went out last night on a pub crawl, a Christmas Eve pub crawl. Look what I woke up with. There, um -- um -- there, um, I'm half an old woman and then back to me again. I don't know what that is; I don't know whether I've got punched in the eye. I don't know what happened, hey, but it's Christmas so it's fun.

﻿Santa baby, slip the sable under the train. Oh, baby, I've been an awful good girl. Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight. 
﻿Merry Christmas, and have a good time.
