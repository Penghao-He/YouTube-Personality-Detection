Hey YouTube, it's XXXX here. How many bloody times have you heard a theist say something like this? 
Well if you don't believe in God, then where do you get your morality from? 
Yeah. We've all heard derivatives of this from the likes of douche bags like William Lane Craig, Ravi Zacharias, etcetera, etcetera. Indeed Christians like to bleat this like the sheep that they are ad nauseum. I know this is a tired topic but bear with me, okay? 
Now I've heard some needlessly ornate rebuttals to this, usually utilizing some convoluted philosophical principle that underlines the philosophy of their argument. But as most of you know by now, XXXX don't go in for all of that fancy book learning. I'm a pretty simple guy, and I'm gonna give you all some common sense here, okay? When asked, where do you get your morality from? 
I usually give a quick answer. And that is, from the same place you do. Myself. And today I'm going to prove it to you. Now my morality as I said is from myself. Essentially, it's more complicated than that but the bottom line is, I assess situations and make moral decisions based on my experience and I judge something to be immoral or moral. I am the filter. Now many theists especially Christians and Muslims subscribe to the idea of divine command theory. Now in a nutshell, divine command theory says that God defines what is moral and immoral, therefore if God commands something it is therefore moral by definition. Now I'm gonna disregard for a moment here in that God's existence has yet to be established, and so no one's in a position to say what God has or has not said at least from a scriptural perspective. Well let's just deal with the claim itself. 
Let me give Mr. Hypothetical Christian a hypothetical scenario. Let's say that one day Mr. Hypothetical Christian is in prayer. And as he is praying, all of a sudden he is blinded by a light and he hears a booming voice and he says, Mr. Christian. Yes, Lord. Is that you speaking to me in an audible voice? Yes, it is. What an honor, Lord. "Mr. Christian, there is an old woman named Thelma Johnson who lives at seventy thirty six Autobahn Street in your home town. I am commanding you to go and buy her a bouquet of flowers, deliver them to her, and tell them I asked you to do this. I promise you will be blessed. I, the Lord have spoken. 
Oh wow, Lord. I can't believe this. This is incredible, thank you. So then Mr. Hypothetical Christian goes and does exactly that, goes and buys a bouquet of flowers and brings them to Mrs. Johnson. Now upon hearing that God asked Mr. Hypothetical Christian to bring her the flowers, Mrs. Johnson is elated, she starts crying, they embrace and start praising God together. Now Mr. Christian, granted you may never have experienced anything like this but what you're say, that this is a reasonable scenario I've drawn out here, that if in fact you heard that voice, you would do that, right? 
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah that sounds good, certainly it would be pretty amazing to hear God's voice audibly I mean he usually doesn't work that way but yeah, that would be wonderful, sure. What a faith affirming thing that would be. 
Okay, fair enough. What if you do a different scenario? Suppose same day, you're praying, blinding light, booming voice. Only this time here's what you hear. Mr. Christian. Yes Lord. Oh my gosh are you speaking to me audibly? Yes Mr. Christian. There is a man living in Van Nuys, California whose very life is an affront to me. He has done wickedness in my sight and is very dangerous. I have chosen you as my emissary of divine justice. Go now and find Mr. Edgar Schnalverdoff he lives at one twenty nine Cedar Street in Van Nuys. Find him and kill him by whatever means necessary. Tell no one of your quest. Once his life is at an end I will see to it that the authorities do not suspect you and great will your reward be in Heaven. I, the Lord have spoken. 
Huh? So okay Mr. Hypothetical Christian, now I pose you this second question. Would you do that? Nah uh, no -- why not? Are you saying God is wrong or is asking you to do something immoral? No you'd get it. God would never command you to do an evil action like that. Really? But you just heard a booming voice, you saw a blinding light, there was no one else in your house, clearly it'sGod speaking to you and asking you to do this, right? No, you don't get it Mr. Atheist, the point is that even if I heard the booming voice and all that and it wasn't God, it was a demon posing as God because he asked me to commit a wicked action, a crime, murder. What is wrong with you atheists? 
Thank you. You're just proving my point. Did you catch it? When Mr. Hypothetical Christian was asked to bring flowers to Mrs. Johnson he was enthralled that God has chosen him to speak to audibly. He immediately went and did exactly as he was told, brought her the flowers and it was an incredible faith affirming event, they were crying, praising God and so on, right? But when Mr. hypothetical Christian was asked to go kill Edgar Schnalverdoff he then does not do what he's asked and in fact says that the booming voice was not God but a demon in disguise because God would never ask him to commit such a crime. 
All right, so let's distill this down now. Booming voice says, give flowers to old lady. Good. Must be God, I'm gonna do it. Booming voice says, go kill a man, not good must be not God but a demon in disguise, not gonna do it. Well Mr. Hypothetical Christian, you just use your own moral faculties to assess the situation and make a moral decision. Therefore I am correct by saying you and I use the same moral barometers. That's why you are baseless by saying to me that as an atheist I have no basis for my morality. I have the same fucking basis that you do. 
And something else I wanna add. I don't just, you know, just make moral decisions just based on how I feel on a given day. No. I have my whole life experience all that I've seen in my short thirty two years on this planet, but I also have history, I have other people's experiences to go on, and collectively we can come to an understanding as to what we think is going to be good for everyone and what is going to be bad. And you know what, a lot of shit is very complicated and it's not easy to always know what is the fully moral decision, and what is the immoral decision. But you know what though, by and large we do pretty much agree. 
The fact is I think it's pretty simple. Whatever causes the least amount of suffering as much as it depends on you, do that. Whatever is going to bring joy and happiness to people, do that. Whatever's gonna cause harm to any sentient being, either animals or human beings avoid that as much as possible. Now granted it's not always easy to do this and it's not always easy to know which is going to result in those things but that should be what we all strive to do. And if you need to be told why we should even do that, why suffering is bad and joy is good, you're a fucking sociopath and I've got no time for you. So, just something to think about. Thanks for watching.
