Hey, everybody. Um, I'm so sorry that I haven't made a video in, like, two weeks. I've been really, really sick. I'm still kind of getting over it. Um, I have bronchitis, actually, which was, like, devilish and I've never had it before and I never wish to get it again, so. 
Anyway, I had purchased, um, some false lashes from China on eBay about a month ago, and I was, like, oh great, I totally got scammed. So, like, I hadn't gotten them, but today they came in and I absolutely love them. 
They were super cheap. I got, um; I got ten of these for, like, a dollar. Um, and then I got forty pairs of lashes that come in, like, a big box like this -- wait a second a bit -- of these. I got those for I think, like, two dollars. Forty pairs of lashes for, like, two dollars. And shipping wasn't that expensive either. It was only, like, three bucks for it -- it to -- it to take, like, a month to get here, but nevertheless, um, I love them. 
But, I have a ton and I know I'm not going to go through them all -- actually um, there's two styles. I mean, they're great quality and I do love them, but there are two styles that I know, like, I'm never ever gonna use. I wear really big, thick, um, like, drag queen lashes at all times. Um, so these -- in these -- let me see 'em -- are not going to cut it for me. They would for, like, ninety five percent of the population. These are, like, everyday lashes, that a lot of people love, but I know I'm never ever gonna wear them. 
So, I'm gonna give them away to you. Uh, two people will get these. Um, just comment below. Type enter me and I will pick the winner -- when will I pick the winner? I will -- the contest will end in -- we'll say a week? I'll post whenever it's gonna end, um, in the side bar, because I'm really indecisive right now. Um, so yeah. Just hit enter me and that will enter you in to win, um, one of these boxes of lashes. There's ten sets in here; ten pairs of lashes. Um, so yeah, they're really great, great quality. Um, I'm really impressed with them. I'm going to link you also to the eBay store that I bought these from because literally, like, forty lashes for a dollar is incredible. 
So, let me just show you. When you put them in a box like this, you just pop them out and -- let me see if I can get this out -- and there's going to be -- do you see the end? You're just going to have to trim this little bit off and then you'll put them on like normal. So, um, don't get confused when there's, um, the lash band kind of extends over the actual lashes -- do you -- all you have to do is just trim that off and put them right back on. The lash band is super, super, um, like, pliable and easy to work with. 
Um, I'm actually wearing some of them right now. I love them. I definitely recommend them if you're a big lash wearer like I am. I wear fake lashes every single day and it gets really expensive. So, I can buy, like, a whole box of lashes like this for, like, five bucks, that's excellent. 
Um, so, I'll put the link up into the side bar. Also the date of when the contest is ending, um, and all that good stuff. 
All right. Bye guys.
