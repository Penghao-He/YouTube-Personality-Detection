Guess why I'm wearing this hat, besides the fact that it's really, really cold out and this hat is pretty awesome, because it is purple, it matches my sweatshirt and my hair and my pants which you can't see through there. Whoo, I'm wearing this hat, because right now, and almost every other second of my life, um, I have the ridiculous urge to pull out my hair. This is a disease call trichotillomania and I have had it for about eleven years since fifth grade. 
Trichotillomania, basically what I just said, is a disease that causes people to compulsively pull out their hair. Yeah, it sucks I've had to wear hats for like months and months and months on end, because like I wouldn't have any hair. And, that's actually the reason that I shaved my head at the end of freshman year. So, my project for Awesome Video this year is in support of the Trichotillomania Learning Center. This is an online resource for children, teens, adults, parents and families of those who have trichotillomania. 
I remember that I was really, really embarrassed to talk about my problems, until I got to college and found a really, really good support group of friends and in the Harry Potter community. For adults it is not as hard to talk about, because they have all ready come into their own as a person and they aren't as embarrassed to talk about stuff that bothers them. But, for kids, especially adolescents, oh my gosh, can you imagine how difficult it would be, if you were going bald and had to wear a hat to school every day and were embarrassed to tell your friends. I know how it feels and the Learning Center offers support, especially for adolescents and teens and young adults who are having lots of problems with trichotillomania. 
I don't really have much more to say, but if you want to learn more about trichotillomania or get involved or donate; you can visit the link in the sidebar. I hope this project for Awesome Day is wonderful for all of you guys and I hope you all find some new charities to support. And I'm so excited that I get to do a project for Awesome again, because it is one of my favorite YouTube videos of the year. So, yay, project for Awesome.
