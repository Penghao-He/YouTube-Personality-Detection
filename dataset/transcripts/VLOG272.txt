It's been a while -- it's been a couple of weeks since I have posted a video. I have been kind of busy with my college chum -- I'm making the videos for the college chum. That does not mean that I have left you all high and dry. 
 You know, I've kind of run out of steam, you know? I've been feeling real, you know, just blah, just not knowing what to -- I was going to make a video, okay, about how to make paper airplanes, okay? This is the level of inspiration that's going on at the moment. I -- I just don't know what to make videos about anymore. Every time I make a video, I -- you know, so I make a video, I type it into the YouTube search engine and there's twenty million videos made that -- about that subject already. I'm just making excuses here. You know? I'm just kind of -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm going to make more videos. 
This blond streak here is probably the most blondest part of my hair and that's a bit odd on its own. Um, yeah, so I need ideas, um, for videos. I need ideas. If you have an idea, I shall make it. If you build it, they will come. If you build it, they will come. Yeah, basically. You build it and I'll come. No. That might be a bit wrong. Anyway, you've got the idea.
