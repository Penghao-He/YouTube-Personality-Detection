So yes, this is really is me, this is XXXX. Look. My hair. It's gone bye bye. I was actually gonna wait until, um, after the wedding, and next summer to cut my hair short, but given the style of -- of the gown and I kept looking at up dos and I just didn't really see any that really went with what I wanted. I kinda decided to go ahead and do it down. But, I didn't want it, like, long and down. So, um, right now it's flipped under, but I can flip it out and it can be all -- because it's layered. 
So I know, I'm sure all of you will have an opinion. I hate it. I love it. How could you? You look ugly now. Oh, you're gorgeous. I don't care. I really don't care to hear any of it. I didn't do it for you guys, and I got permission from my mom and -- and uh, XXXX , not that it matters. Uh, not permission, but you know what I mean. 
So um, I just kinda wanna update you guys. Um, a couple of things. One is we are close to three hundred dollars raised on the poverty project, which sounds not, like, not that much when you consider everyone, but if you think of it another way, we're ten percent of the way there, and ten percent's quite a bit. It's quite a bit, you know? So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that, um, I'm not gonna let it go. I'm not going to so, um, if you guys are sick and tired of hearing me talk about it, but you still love me to death, then you're just going to have donate, so we get the three thousand and I quit asking you to go donate. By the way, go donate, on MySpace, blog, um, Fineloss has a donate button. Whatever the last blog I have a donate button on is, that's the most recent total. That's where I keep updating, because I have so many, I don't go back and update every single total. I update the most recent one. 
Um, let's see, um, more news, um, I just get -- heard a little more from YouTube about this gathering thing. Um, I just got, um -- they sent us a flip, uh, cam -- video camera, which rocks. Um, I already had one. Now apparently, I'll have two, and I'm going to definitely use both. Um, not -- not double fisted. I won't be, like, whooo, look at all that, yeah, you know? No. 
But XXXX takes a lot of video of um, the doggie cat, which I sh -- don't tell, because it might not -- you know, don't -- it's not for sure yet, but they're -- they're discussing the cat and dog. Are having some talks about having a merger and if they do so, they would have their own channel. So -- and, and they just -- the biggest thing right now is they can't decide on a name. Would it be the Ophelia and Justice Show or the Justice and Ophelia Show? 
See, Justice says that he should get precedence because no one has seen him yet, really and everyone wants to see his puppy videos and him growing up, and we have all those videos, and he thinks that there's some power to that, you know? He thinks that, um, that exclusivity should get him the first name. 
But then Ophelia is, like, hey, I've already been on YouTube, I'm tried and true, I have fans, they love me. They're gonna stick by me, bitch. She calls him bitch, even though he's not a bitch, he's a male dog, um, but that -- that's her, you know, she calls -- she calls us all bitch at times. Um, well, she's probably called me a bitch when she doesn't have as much hair to lick and eat on anymore. Um, so, yes, um, that's probably where the other flip phone is gonna go for. 
But, just so you guys know, I'm gonna give a shout out. I know I don't ever do it on this channel. Um, I don't ever talk about companies or anything, except for my personal one, but hey, shout out to uh, flip phones. Uh, looks like the brand is M I-N O, Mino. I don't know but -- but flip video, um, they're awesome, literally, I mean because I -- I bought one before. I'm not just saying they're awesome because they gave me a free one. I bought one three weeks ago. Yeah, great. Um, and then they're, like, oh yeah, well, Flip is sponsoring this event so you guys get one. That's nice, hah. Shoulda told me three weeks ago. 
Anyway, um, it just -- it records, um, on flash memory and then you click a button and the USB thing pops out and you just click it in, and you download it to your computer. It is awesome for just taking little videos here and there. Um, definitely an awesome one. So I'm gonna go ahead and plug them. I don't know the website. Google it. 
Um, the -- the other thing is, okay, yeah, um -- sorry, you're gonna have to move a little bit. Um, YouTube had asked me uh, what my t shirt size was, and I said small if it was unisex, and they ran out of small so they sent me a medium. Well, look fucking cool this is. Yeah, yeah, it says player. That's right, it says -- it says playa, and then on the back of course it says YouTube. I'm a YouTube playa. It's official, they sent it to me. I got a letter, it was handwritten. I can show it to you if you want. But then, since they'd run out of mediums, guess what they sent me? Guess. I'm gonna give you guys a second, just go ahead and guess. They sent me YouTube socks. Hello, I mean, I know I'm being silly, but I mean, hello socks. XXXX, I mean. Can you mix the two anymore? I -- I think I might have to start YouTubing in these socks constantly until they stink so bad XXXX throws them away. I don't know. So, I'm not only a YouTube playa, I have YouTube socks now. I mean, come on. 
So, I got that package and a handwritten -- handwritten -- handwritten letter from YouTube. I don't think you believe me; I'm gonna show you. Can you see? Can you see? It's hand written. It wasn't just a blanket, like, you know, pre printed card. Anyway, so quickly, before I lose -- um, sorry, for, yeah -- I know, I'm not comfortable either. Okay, you guys, you guys a little more comfortable? 
Um, I'm really tired, that's why I'm hyper by the way. Um, I get really talkative and ta -- talkative and hyper when I'm really sleepy. I barely got any sleep last night 'cause we bought XXXX a Mac. I converted him, yeah. And then, guess what else we got today -- guess what else? We got iPhones. We did. Um, his computer was paid for by um, the company he -- he works for so, no, we didn't go out and spend a shit ton on a new laptop. We don't have that kinda money. 
Um, but, uh, we -- we did buy iPhones because they're going to be essentially important, specially for me um, to get work done on the run, so I don't have to -- I don't have to be stuck at home anymore. Very cool, and then soon hopefully, they're going to be doing tethering which means I can use it uh, yeah, as internet for my computer. 
Okay, quickly, the last thing, oh my gosh. I'm -- I'm gonna run outta time. I think I can do a lot of minutes on this channel, I think. Let's hope. Um, the second thing -- the second thing? We're not on number two. 
The last thing. Last and far from least important, in fact the most important is October thirtieth at nine PM eastern standard time, I'm going to be live on Blog TV. Tell your friends. Tell everyone. I'm going to be live on Blog TV and I'm for two and a half hours, as long as there's enough questions to last that long, if no one shows up, then lonely little me will stick around for fifteen minutes and say bye bye to nobody. Um, but if you guys come by, you can say hi. Um, you guys can -- but, the main reason is for sex questions. So --
