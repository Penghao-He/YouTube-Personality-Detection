Sh, XXXX's rocking out of XXXX today. 
Hi guys, how's it going? 
We're vlogging on the floor. Just so it's sexual. 
Mmm, vlogger. 
Sky, I want to know if she's going to 
You know, I never really understood, when do people like, compete to better you on negative things. 
I'll explain through the medium of Sketch. Yes. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I'm 
That's fun. 
I was up until two last night finishing the assignment. 
You think that's bad, I was up until seven, and I didn't get to sleep until eight, and I have to be up at six. 
So, Millie, 
Mm hmm, 
I forgot a pen. 
Oh, you think that's bad, I forgot my whole bag. 
Your bag is there. Ow, ow. 
You think that's bad, I just don't understand why you'd want to prove that you came out worse in this situation. Hm, maybe it's just me, I don't like bad things happening to me, but whatever floats your boat. 
That's stupid, what do I do now? 
Let's go for a walk. 
I have an Oreo, yay. 
Oh, fail. One Oreo is not so bad, shame enough for people. Three quick shout outs I want to give, one is to Steven three sixty five , he recently, like, hulled me out to the max and got me like I should have loads of subscribers. Thank you so much Steven. You should go and check him out, like, who isn't subscribed to him, but like I'm going to get many subscribers. And the second one is Shamrock Baby. I'm really sorry I can't remember the numbers after your name, but I'll put it here. She also made a video advertising me which was out of pure kindness which was just so nice of you. Thank you so much. 
The third shout I'm going to give is someone I think you should definitely go and subscribe to and that's my friend XXXX. XXXX on YouTube; she makes the best videos ever; she's nearly at three hundred subscribers and I honestly don't understand why more people don't subscribe, because she is amazing; I love her so much; so go and subscribe to her . 
Okay. So I'll speak to you all soon guys, .
