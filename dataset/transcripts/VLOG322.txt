This is hair of epic proportions. 
Hello, YouTube. It's Thursday, the first of October. Pinch punch first of the Month. Hell, yes. And now you can't do it. No wait, wait, wait, wait -- what is it? Kick Slap Can't Do It Back. But I can't kick you 'cause I'm wearing a pencil skirt and that would not be pre ey. Pre ey. I sound like a commoner. So yes, it's Thursday, and I'm in desperate need of some hair attention, but I'm not overly fussed. At this very second in time I am here to talk to you. 
Last video I asked you guys to set me challenges, and while your challenges may be interesting, I'm not gonna eat stuff. You saw what happened with the peanut butter poetry. I haven't eaten peanut butter since and the thought of eating peanut butter makes me feel physically sick. So, I'm gonna turn down the eating stuff challenges unless it's something I've actually might consider eating, but unless it's sort of like chocolate, it's veto. Okay guys, I'm not gonna eat anything; get that out of your system please. And I've got another thing I want to ask you guys about. I'm planning to cover some for you guys, but I'm very, very indecisive as to what to do, so put some suggestions down there. I -- It can either be something that I could cover, or it could be something I could do a music video for, or -- yeah. I'm gonna fill the rest of this video with me making an idiot of myself. Wish me luck.

I will be the very best, like no one ever was. 
To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause. 
I will travel across the land, searching far and wide, 
Each Pokemon to understand, the power that's inside. 
Pokemon gotta catch 'em all
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon oh you're my best friend, 
In a world we must defend. 
Pokemon gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true, our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah, gotta catch 'em all.
