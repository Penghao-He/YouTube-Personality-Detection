Westboro Baptist Church, everyone's getting fed up with them disrespecting people. Soldiers have gone over seas to fight in a war, get killed, those assholes standup and protest. Well, hey, I'm not in the military. I haven't been in the military but it's pissing me off and I know it's pissing you off. 
Well, I'm in Australia so I can't do much to help. But what I'm suggesting now, I would like this to go all over the internet and for everybody to find out about it. 'Cause I'm calling for YouTubers, US military reservists, people in the that's serving in the military full time, anyone who's available, to go to the Westboro Baptist Church on the Fourth of July two thousand and ten and protest against them. Disrupting funerals of the honored dead; what they're doing is not right. YouTube, the military, and everybody at least to show them how we feel. So, protest Westboro Bap-- Westboro Baptist Church, Fourth of July two thousand and ten. Go for it. Have fun.
