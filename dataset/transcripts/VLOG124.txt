I just woke -- hey YouTube, um, I -- I -- I can't actually tell you how drunk I was last night, I just -- I just, fuck, oh my God is right. This is one of the five bottles of wine I polished my way through and then I think I drank eight pints of something at the nightclub and I've just -- oh my God. Look at my eyes, oh. 
I didn't get up until about an hour ago, and it's now a quarter past four, so yes, that's what I -- and I woke up on my sofa. I wanna die. Look I have one fucking cigarette left, look -- look at that. Does that ever happen to anyone, by the way? Like the obviously. The top of your packet always comes off after a night out. I don't what that's all about, but I always wake up and like the top of my packet's, like, fallen off. 
Oh, well, of course I'm attractive, this is me, beautiful, aren't I? Beautiful, oh, crap, okay, um, I'll try to say something vaguely interesting. 
All I can say, this offends me. Okay, I probably shouldn't really say that either. This is what our stupid England call a TV license. Hello, I'm a TV license , right, why do I have to pay -- let's see my letter. I have to pay thirty seven pounds every three months so that I can watch my telly. And, do you know what as well, it only covers the fucking BBC, fucking BBC, what does the fucking BBC do that I watch? Fuck all. I don't watch and I don't the X factor, which is on ITV, not fucking BBC so you can go stuff your fucking TV license. 
Well, I tried to say that I tried to stop the TV license, and some man came knocking on my door and said that if I didn't pay it then I'd get a thousand pounds fine, so I was like, what? So I paid it. 
But yeah, oh my God, I don't really get hangovers, but I can't tell you how drunk I was. I think I spent ninety fucking quid -- of course, that wasn't all on alcohol. Not that I was doing anything wrong. 
Anyway, I had waffles a little bit now, uh yeah, I just thought everyone should see the beauty that is me after a night out. Just in case anyone wants to sleep with me, and then this is what you'd be waking up next to, not pretty, no, not even a little bit. Not even a smidgen, so anyway, I hope you all have a lovely day and I'm going to practice again Monday morning, because I'm going out Sunday night, to get I'm going to forget about all bills. Another fucking letter came through today from fucking Scottish Power -- about my bills. Anyway, I love you, bye.
