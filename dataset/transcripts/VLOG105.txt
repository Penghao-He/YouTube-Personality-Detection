Hello everyone, as you can see it's not Thursday, but I don't care if I own half of this channel I believe that, you know, I can do what ever I want. We don't have any rules. Anyway, the actually reason that I didn't persevere this Tuesday was because well one, posted on Monday and it just seemed weird to post on Tuesday, and two, I was absolutely shattered. Why, you might ask? Well, let's go into that now. See you all had a four day weekend in England well or Crawley to be exact. That is just half and hour by train south of London and it was very good and I have been vlogging about it on my personal channel -- oh, that reminds me, I should really post the last post of that. I should really get on that. So, it's been an eventful week after the whole karate thing. On Monday we went into London and we went to the British Museum for this exhibition and it was really good. We went around London and saw all the sights and stuff kind of got a visit. And I got loads of photos and stuff, which will probably be going on my last video on my personal channel and then on Tuesday, we had like half a day cause we had to like get to the airport then so we went into Crawley, into the actual town, and we went into HMV and got some DVDs one of which was this, Dark Than Black volumes one and two which is episodes one to ten. Very good series, I really do recommend it and then, as I said, after we got back, I was shattered and then I was back to school on Wednesday, the entire day of which we went on this careers exhibition at Rotterdam Park Hotel in Quark. It's this thing where loads of colleges and universities from the UK and Ireland are represented and I got plenty of literature such as this CIT prospectus and, you know, it was very informative, very interesting and it wasted the day. And on Thursday it was back to proper school and that was real culture shock and then it was today and I am now reading this book The Star that's written by H. G. Wells. It was written in like the thirties or something, but it is very good, I would recommend this as well. And over the weekend I have to do an art essay and I've opted to do this film for it, so that should be fun. I think that is everything. Ah, Luke, I will see you whenever. What was that? I don't know. What was I going for there? On to the music section.
