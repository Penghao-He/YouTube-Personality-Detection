Hey everyone, it's XXXX and it's been a while since I've put anything on my personal channel, but I thought this would be a good mix with the type of video -- the caliber, if you will, of videos that I posted on my personal channel, um, whether I'm stuck in a box, or, uh, you know, a spider down below. Uh, I think that this might -- might fit well. 
Uh, I had mentioned that I learned via Darrings Dance Grooves. I don't know if any of you used it back in like eighth grade or something, or maybe you young's are too young for it. But um, Darrings Dance Grooves helped me learn a chorus of Britney Spears' You Drive Me Crazy, so I danced it up for you guys. I just did it, so it's a little bit backwards. But, um, I learned it and I did it and it's there. So, uh, don't judge me too harshly. I have no dance background. I just -- I just like to dance. Just got to dance. Screw girls tonight. I just want to dance. 
"You can not do/You drive me crazy/I just can't sleep/I'm so excited I'm in too deep/Ohh, crazy, but it feels all right/Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night. "
I just wanted to say hey and um, I know that I've had a bunch more new -- new viewers so thank you so much. I'm glad that you think I'm interesting. I guess that is kind of validating for the -- for the things that I do in my life so I hope that you stick around, that you comment and send video responses. 
If you have learned anything on Darrings Dance Grooves, 'fess up. Whether it's via video or comments, I want to hear about it. 
Um, I am like always on here doing the weirdest things. I'm so sorry, I feel like I , huh, it's-- it's three in the morning you guys, this is like the afternoon for me. I -- I -- all my friends get tired and then I am still up so I do this. This is my life. I am a vampire. 
I know that you lesbians are really into vampires. I don't know why. Well actually I do because I think it's pretty hot too. But, um, but I am a vampire. I stay up late at night. I rarely see the sun as you can tell by my pale complexion. I just -- I just want to talk to someone. 
I wish that other people were awake at 3 am and would like do this stupid shit with me 'cause it's not really fun when I'm doing it alone and talking to my computer. You know, when -- when you watch it, it doesn't seem so weird because you're like watching it but when I'm doing it alone in my house at three A. M. , little creepy. 
So this is my life. I'm living it. 
Okay. Byyyyyyyyyye.
