Hello YouTube. Ah, I was approached by one of my viewers on one of my uh, XXXX videos uh, or because of my XXXX videos to uh, share her story and after reading her story I of course said I would. 
And uh, given that uh, the comment on this video will be approval pending and the reason behind that is, is I don't feel that there's any argument with it so I'm not going to allow any -- I mean, if you can respectfully argue your point and if you disagree, you know, respectfully, I may actually let those comments be approved. But if I see basically what looks like trolling, they're not going to be approved. 
Um, the five star ratings will still be allowed, but that will be the extent of it and as you know I have never done this to any of my videos. So obviously I feel very strongly about this subject and I feel that arguing, you know, below the video would simply devalue the story in itself. 
So I will get started. Um, I also don't know how long this video will be because I am not going to chop any of this story up. I will be reading as it was written to me. 
I am XXXX. I am prochoice and this is why. Here is my story. When I was sixteen I had a baby. Aborting and adoption was no option for me; my choice. My parents raised me, if you make a mistake own up to it and I did. 
When my son was six months old, three men came to my door asked for my ex brother in law. At the time we had no screen door or a window to look out of to see who was there. I told him that he wasn't there and they barged in and then two of them raped me. Cops where called, evidence was collected. I was not given any pills as they do today to rape victims. All I got was dressing like that, no wonder, you're just asking for trouble. I was wearing a tube shirt and shorts at the time because it was hot and I had the door and window shut. When I go out in public, I wear a T shirt and jeans and still do to this very day. 
One month passed and my worst fear became a reality. I was pregnant. Again, abortion and adoption was no option; my choice. I went to my second doctor's visit and he told me that every thing was fine, but it wasn't. The man lied. Now child services got involved when more -- even more and said that I was immature and that my son would be better off without me. So I ran with him and moved to any other city before they could get their hands on him. I know it was wrong, but what other option did I have? Stay there and they take my son or leave and hold on to him. 
Anyways, living in a new city I though every thing would be better. I got a job, visited the doctor. I thought everything was going great. The second child was born. Two weeks passed after his birth and I new something was wrong with this child. Oh no, everything is fine; your just over reacting. Next visit everything wasn't so fine. He stopped breathing. He was rushed to a children's hospital finding out that he had a vessel from his heart wrapped around his wind pipe. This could be corrected, but there was more. His body temperature was -- his body temperature was below normal, his weight, and he had MS leaving him blind and deaf. Here's the real kicker, always leaving worst for last, he had incurable brain cancer. 
I knew that there was something wrong because this child never cried, always gasping for air. He never moved or anything. He just laid there. They explained that it was -- it wasn't my fault which I was grateful; at least someone was on my side. I was also told that according to my medical chart the doctor who took care of me knew all about it from the first visit. I confronted him and asked why he lie -- why did he lie to me. His reply, he would have terminated the pregnancy. You're absolutely right, I would have. That poor little boy suffered for eight and a half months. I took him home where he later died. 
This is why now I have become prochoice. No one, and I mean no one, as the right to with hold information or to tell some one what they can and cannot do because of what they believe in. Prolife people only tell you one side of the story, like someone who had an abortion and regretted it or someone who is raped and is happy they didn't do it. They never tell the story of people like me. 
If I knew then what I know now, I would have gotten the abortion. A child should never have to suffer that kind of pain. Parents should never have to sit and watch their child suffer, knowing that they had other options and was denied that option. 
Why didn't I give him up for adoption? Now honestly, would you take a child that you know is going to die or would you take one that was healthy? Besides, I never really like adoptions and don't highly recommend, but I would never tell anyone that they couldn't either. That is totally up to them. 
I had three sisters that were taken away from my parents just because my dad lost his job and had no money at the time. Child Services did not give my father any time to look for a job -- for a new job before coming in and ripping his children from them. No job, no money, no children. My parents had no choice. Someone made that for them. 
Thank you for listening to my story. I hope this helps someone in whatever decision they make in life. 
I'm not going to comment any further, but there is a question that needs to be asked and I'll let this ask it.
