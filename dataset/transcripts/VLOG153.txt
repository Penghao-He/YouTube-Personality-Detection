So like, I wanted to bring up a really kind of interesting point -- uh -- first off, you know, I'm still shocked that Michael Jackson is gone -- um -- I have nothing but respect for him. I just wanted to bring up a point about some of the rumors that are spread about him, and just offer you a little bit of insight on what those might mean. So like a lot I've talked to those know that people like to jump on the wagon of spreading rumors, and let's face it, rumors don't really involve any kind of thinking, and a lot people don't like to think. So perfect -- there's your audience base. People in the media know that the more extreme something sounds, the more people are gonna wanna watch it and listen to it, and that's why some of these rumors get spread about him. 
Okay like, one of the funny things is, is that a lot of the media personalities who say these horrible things about Michael Jackson, they don't really believe them. But that's how they get views, and that's how their shows get attention. But like, you know, the only thing that's really left to say about Michael Jackson is you know, number one, he is gone. And number two, he left us with amazing music, and -- um -- you know, I really think we could just let that be.
