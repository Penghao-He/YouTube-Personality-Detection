Hey everybody. Um, this video is very important for a simple fact. This is my last video before I turn twenty. Yeah, this Tuesday, September twenty second, I turn twenty years old. For me that's a big thing
You know, it's like a decade of your life is gone. It -- you know, it's kinda scary because, you know, you're forced to just grow up so fast and it just -- it's like a reality check that you're not ready for. But um, you know, I want to thank everybody who has been friends with me for the past, well I can say, twenty years. I mean, I've had ups, downs, I've lost friends, I've gained friends. I mean, my last couple of weeks have not been the best. 
I got in a pretty rough car accident a few weeks back. Well, not even weeks back, it was like, last week, on Wednesday. But, yeah, I was about three inches from having my windshield bust out and, it -- it -- it literally like woke me up because I'm just like, holy crap, I could've probably died. 
So, you know, you gotta really watch how you take life, cause you could take it for granted and the next day it would be over. So, it's just something you gotta keep in mind, you know? But, I -- turning twenty . It's scary, I know. For me, I'm like scared shitless, I'm not ready. I'm not. But I guess I'll see what happens, but again, I love you all. Make sure you wish me happy birthday. Even happy birthday reply videos would be amazing, but I love you guys so, so, so, so much and here's to you, guys. I love you. 
Hi.
