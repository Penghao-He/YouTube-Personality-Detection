Hello, everyone. It's XXXX. Hi, XXXX. This morning I enjoyed watching your One Man's Opinion video and you may be surprised to learn that I have no disputes, no disagreements with uh, basically, anything that you said. 
But I think that where -- and you can tell me if I'm wrong -- where our opinions might begin to diverge is what happens after you try your best at being a bootstrap kind of guy, uh, and you fail. I mean, we all know what happens if we work hard and if we are successful and we can take care of ourselves. Life is good. But the missing pieces -- what happens when things awry? 
Now oftentimes it's through no fault of the person. For instance, somebody loses a job and in turn loses their healthcare. A person who gets sick and gets dropped from his coverage, or a person who has a preexisting condition and can't get coverage at any kind of an affordable rate. I mean, what do we do with people like that -- people like that who, by the way, could be you -- could be me, no one knows what tomorrow will hold. 
And we -- in most of my videos, uh, I like to note that I don't necessarily try to be persuasive, uh, to get people to see my point of view or to change to my point of view. I happen to be a persuasive guy so that just happens but it's -- it's not the intent. Normally what I'm trying to do is, you delve into a concept, something above the -- the fray, something above the raucous, misfit -- uh -- that's normally the political debate. 
For instance, in the healthcare debate, everyone's talking about things that have nothing to do with healthcare itself. So, you know, diving into those things doesn't really do any good. I'm trying to get above that, and, you know, maybe talk about things that are important to people. That might be something worth talking about, and that's . 
Uh, when I was watching your video, I started to think, you know, we -- we all feel proud of being American. It's a great country. But what are we really saying when we're saying we're proud to be American? Is it just, we're proud of our achievements? Do we care at all about those who, for whatever reason, are having difficulties? 
To me, the country -- being a part of the country is akin to being a part of any other community. And any community, whether it be family, friends, neighborhoods -- it's not uncommon for there to be an outreached hand or to try to help those who have a need. 
This particular discussion about healthcare -- it's really scary to me that those who have healthcare now, like myself, settle that they're okay and they very well might be today. But we have to think about what will happen tomorrow. Now -- and the insurance companies have thrown a whole lot of money into derailing this, and unfortunately, they're being successful. And I touched upon that in my last video. 
But I've got to think that people should be more -- should be more foresighted and see that this is not a debate only for insuring those who do not have insurance. It's a debate to try to make the entire insurance business one that will not run us into bankruptcy. And I think that as a country, we should pull together to fix what is clearly a broken, uh, system. Some things -- I'm a capitalist, I assure you, and I'm out there trying to make money like everyone else. 
But some things do not work within capitalism alone. Governments have a place. Hopefully it's to do the will of the people and also to do the right thing even if sometimes it's unpopular, as was the initial, uh, vote on Social Security. There were many people who were saying saying things they're just saying now about the horrors that would happen. They were saying the same things then that they're saying now. And none of those things happened. 
It indicates -- looking back on my whole life, I know that someone gave me an opportunity, deserved or undeserved. Someone did. It had nothing to do with my abilities, or my will, or my perseverance. I could be the brightest guy in the world -- which I'm not -- but if I were, I still would need someone else to give me a chance. Someone forgave my youthful indiscretions, my youthful impertinence. Someone thought it was a good idea to provide education for our young. Someone decided it was important to build roads. Someone also thought that it would be a good idea to provide health insurance and healthcare to people -- Americans -- when they got old. Someone decided to build -- to build systems for clean water and systems to dispose water through sewage. 
These are all things that an individual cannot accomplish. So for those who say that government has no place, I think that's wrong. Now what happens sometimes is that this process gets corrupted, and consequences ensue which you and me are not happy with. But I think it's not even debatable that there is a place for government and that there are many things that individuals -- the best and the brightest, the luckiest, whatever category you want to put them in -- cannot achieve on their own. 
So I believe that now is one of those times, just like when we built the roads or the water, sewage. We should find a way to fix the healthcare system, to find a way to be good Americans and take care of one another. 
Bye bye now.
