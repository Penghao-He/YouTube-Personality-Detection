Hmm, welcome to my hair. So I just wanted to do a couple of quick updates. 
First of all, I just want you to know those rumors are true, I did, um, have a thing with Tiger and, I'm just glad to know I'm not alone. Second of all, er, our Christmas thing that we did last night turned out really good. Some of you knew about it, so I'm just telling you, it turned out good. 
And b, I'm going to do Christmas cards, and if you want a Christmas card from me, please make sure that I have your most current address, and your, um, name, because some of you -- I only know your names. So, please email me your, um, details, I'll put my email where stuff goes, you know. 
And finally, I want you to know that I had an epiphany tonight watching Nip Tuck. Do you watch Nip Tuck? If you don't, you should. It's on FX channel. Erm, I think that nipples are the answer to the universe. Yes, I said nipples. Why do men have nipples? Discuss.
