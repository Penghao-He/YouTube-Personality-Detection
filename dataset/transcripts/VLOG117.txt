Hey there people. Are you tired of not having an egg? Well, if you pay enough money we can give you an egg. The egg is great for any household and it even moves. Wow, that's really cool isn't it? And, for a mere price of four thousand dollars you can get this egg. I mean, don't take my word for it; why don't you take some one like Greg Bell's word for it. Hah, hah, it's really good. Oh, Greg you're so funny. Hah, and anyways if you call in the next fourteen minutes we'll give you my -- my -- my sister's bra? Okay, well then, order now. 
Mommy, have you seen my bra? 
Uh? 
Hey, that's mine, geez! 
Aww, come on; I need it for --
Stay out of my room! 
I need it for a video. 
I don't care. 
Aww, come on. 
Stay out of my room. I'm getting tired of you going through my bras and panties. And stop trying to sell my stuff. God!
