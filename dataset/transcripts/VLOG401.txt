Hey, um, YouTube. I am on my mother's laptop right now. Um, she's currently letting me use it for the weekend, which is amazing. So I get to make videos with her really cool webcam, which is so much better than mine, I think. Um, starting to cover up this area because I'm laying on my bed. Um, I'm pretty bored right now. Um, I should go to bed, but I kind of don't want to. You know how that goes. 
Um, so I went to the beach and I've got a little color on my face, and right here on my -- . I wore a shirt, so kind of, the color doesn't start 'til like my arm. So I'm kind of not really, you know, tanned or anything, I'm still kind of pale. But anyway, I really wanted to make a video so I can say hi to everybody, and just kind of just catch up. And I was like I just wanna make a video while laying down which is nice. Just to lay down. 
My cat is actually right over here. She right there. Say hi, Tina. You are on YouTube. I actually don't think she cares about YouTube so, blah, goes to show you how cats are. My mom is currently watching Brawls Brothers right now, the fifty jokes in four minutes. She watched the most recent one, now she's watching all the others. 
And I keep staring at myself 'cause I can't help it. I just can't. Um, Babababababa. But I really don't know what to talk about because I dunno. I just -- the beach was amazing. It was a family day trip with my little brother, my little sister -- my mom, me, Barry and Lillian. We had a fabulous time. Thank you so much, Mom, for the trip, I really appreciate it. It was so great. Like, me and my little brother -- like me and my little brother, like we were going through the waves and you know attacking 'em and being weird and it was like, I dunno, it was just like being a little kid again. Even though I'm twenty one, I have a kid. It made me for a minute think wow, you know, I'm still young. I'm not as old as I think I am. 
But anyway, I'm gonna go. So, I hope you guys are doing well, my subscriber people. I miss you. I don't know if you miss me. But um, anyway I guess I'd better go. Um, who knows, I might get on Sticky M, or something and talk to people. Because this is so awesome, to be like anywhere I want and be able to blog or something as long as it has Wi Fi, but no. Tina is purring so I'm going to give her attention so I really do have to go. 
But, um, have a great weekend and I work tomorrow from three to twelve AM. Three PM to twelve AM, isn't that just a little insane? No, not really. I actually don't mind that shift as much as other people do, because you get one hour by yourself, when you really don't have anything to do but to sit there, which is actually not bad. Um, but I'm gonna go, so -- . 
Oh yeah, I'm wearing a Hello Kitty shirt, and um yeah. Because it's already four minutes and I've already said I've had to go a bunch of times. Um, yeah. Oh, and I get my engagement ring back from the jewelers tomorrow. It's been gone because it was almost losing stones and it was scary, so yeah. My face looks so weird on this camera. Is it just me or do I look different? Maybe it's the angle. I just feel like I look different. Maybe it's my hair, I never wore it like that. Hmm, I don't know, it doesn't matter. Alright, good night, you guys. I love you.
