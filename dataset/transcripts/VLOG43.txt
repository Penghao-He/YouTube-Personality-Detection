Hey guys, so I went shopping the other day and because I wanted to avoid all those horrible things that happen to people who pay with cash on those debit card commercials, I, of course, used my debit card. But you know I realized that with all the things you have to input after you swipe your card, perhaps cash is faster after all. 
Your total is twenty three seventy four. 
All right, um, I'm just gonna do debit so I'll just, um, swipe. 
*beep beep*
Oh, right, PIN number. 
*beep*
Uh, no cash back. 
*beep*
Okay, that is correct. 
*beep*
My sister? 
*beep*
I don't see how that really applies. 
*beep*
What? 
But seriously, though, sometimes it's like playing twenty questions with those things and not only that, but um, usually when you swipe your card, you swipe it at the wrong time and then the cashier looks at you like you're a dumbass for trying to pay for your shit. Um, anyway though, uh if you read my blog you'll know that I've been working on a little EP and I've decided to release it November twenty third, uh, the XXXX EP. Obviously two songs that I've already done are on it, uh, XXXX in XXXX which I've made music videos to, and plus a remix of XXXX and three other songs that I've worked really hard on and am proud of. 
So to make things a little more interesting I thought I would hold a little contest leading up to it on November twenty third. So all you have to do is you follow me on Twitter -- my Twitter is just twitter dot com slash XXXX and I will be giving out XXXX from my last video -- I have a ton of them. So I'll Twitter something like, the eleventh person to reply to this Twitter about my EP will uh, win a paper crane, and then if you're the eleventh person, I'll send you a direct message and get that sent on to you. So the link to my Twitter will be in the description and also a link where you can find more information about the EP. 
I'll be making a music video to one of my favorite songs that I made on the album called XXXX and that'll be out sometime soon. You'll also be able to download the EP on, like, iTunes, Rhapsody, all of those music download sites and hopefully I'll also have a physical copy that you can actually buy. I'm also planning a few other special things for it coming out, but more about that later. 
Um, that's it for now, so bye guys!
