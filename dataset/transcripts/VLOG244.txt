There were two in the bed and the little one said, "It's time for a blog. " Hello, I'm starting to become rather lonely doing these blogs. I mean, I knew a little friend from, like, back there. It's just kinda, you know, sad, me sitting here talking to a computer all day without anyone else to speak to. It's not fair; I have a lollypop. 
Ah, something interesting has popped up. Today I opened the door and there stood my friends, Katy and Sophie. And one of them said; "Hello, David. There's a little bird in your path. " And of course I replied, "What? " "Yes, dear. It's a little blackbird and it's not moving. " So, at this point, I went, "Oh my God, there's a blackbird in my path. " And there was a blackbird in my path. And it was a little, fuzzy bird, and it had a big ; you know, I mean, a big . 
Anyway, that blackbird has been outside, not moving, for about nine hours. No, no, no, no, no. It was outside for about five hours, until my dad decided to bring it in the house, so now we have a blackbird in my house underneath a little crate with all this newspaper and -- and little bits of bread to feed it. It can't fly. It just hops about, because . And it's -- it's nice, but it's not. It could have diseases, like, I don't know, like . 
Anyway, basically. if it can't fly, but it's still able to live, we have to keep it. Which I can't do, because I don't want a blackbird flying about in my house. . 
You just need to . I have an Eiffel Tower in my pants. Do you like my shirt? 
The Zebra Ice Cube man will return after this short commercial: "And today is November of two thousand and nine in the month of July . "
Yeah, I had to make this video because I was extremely bored. And I have not made one in about -- whoo oo -- a week. Ah, someone is speaking to me on MSN . Isn't this fun? No. Do you like my new theme tune? I did that myself. It's quite catchy, isn't it? Uh hum. I have a lollypop. I probably said that, but I have a lollypop. Uh oh, I broke my mouse. 
The color of white. There're just over seven weeks 'till Christmas. Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. . You know, I couldn't really think of anything to say, but I guess that's it. With that, I'll start this again. That's all for now. Goodbye. What?
