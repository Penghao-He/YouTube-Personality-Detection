Socializing is somewhat of a difficult task for me. You may be asking yourself, what is so difficult about socializing? Would it be the awkward silence in between series of questions? Nope. Or maybe it's the fact that you state one of your interests as collecting dictionaries? What? No. Oh, look, an Italian dictionary, um bi net oo, toilet. Or perhaps it's awkward that you tell people you write blog skits for YouTube? Why did I write that in there? Socializing is awkward simply because I have to state my name. Yup, that's it. And scenarios like this have rolled around, roll it. 
Hi. 
Hello, my name is Tina, what's your name? 
My name is XXXX. 
What? 
Maybeen. 
May --May -- been? Maydon? 
XXXX! 
XXXX? 
XXXX. 
Maaayyyyy--
You know what, I lied. My name's Bob. 
Oh, Bob, nice to meet you. 
Yep, that's my name. Usually it's used for boys but I'm special, you know, very special. Or maybe something like this would roll around: 
Hey, my name is XXXX. 
Hi, I'm Ann. 
Two weeks later. 
Hey, Ann. 
Hi, Michelle. 
It's become so bad that I don't pronounce my name in French anymore because people can't seem to grasp it. So, I'm wondering, do you have scenarios like this? Leave a text comment below or give me a video response. Bye, bye, . Thanks for watching. Keep nerding it up, nerrrrrrrrrrrrr--
