Hey there, so Ms. XXXX put me up to a challenge in her video, link's down there, cause this is going to be a video response. 
Um, she wants people to try to eat bananas, which I have all cut up in fun with ketchup, which is probably as gross as it sounds, but -- and as gross as it looks. But she wants a lot of ketchup on there, and well, don't want to disappoint, so I'm just going to -- oh God. Okay, okay. 
It almost looks like cherry sauce stuff and that with bananas would probably be good, so I'm going to imagine that this is cherry sauce. My taste buds don't want it to be -- to be cherry sauce. Oh God, I like ketchup too, but, oh God, no. Okay, I'm not going to recommend that to anybody, ever, no day , no. But uh, I got two pieces down, and I just wasted half a banana for this video and I like bananas. Ehh, ehh, uhh, don't do it, doo dee doo dee doo. Subscribe! I dropped it.
