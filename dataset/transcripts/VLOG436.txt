What's up, XXXX? Don't you know, my name's XXXX. What's up, man? So I'm getting back to you today on, uh, your vlog. The one where you had mentioned about people, you know us, the XXXX and you, doing a weight loss deal for September and you know, I'm throwing my two cents. I'm down to do that with you guys and uh, if you want to lose weight and you need some inspiration, I'll be here for you, man. Just, uh, as long as you're my inspiration. You know, we could work together and just bust tail. Bust tail . This past year, I've been trying to lose weight, and I -- I've succeeded pretty well. I've lost seventy one pounds total -- you know, in total. Uh, but I gained twenty pounds back in the past two, three months which is a bummer, because I busted, you know, I busted my -- my butt to do that and to get that far. 
So I need to get back on the bandwagon and do this, so if you're going to do it, I'm down and I will support you one hundred percent. And it's funny, 'cause you were talking about, uh, you know XXXX, who looked like a Marine. Basically that's what I'm trying to lose weight for, because I want to join the Marine Corps. And, uh, I've already passed one of my deadlines which is a bummer too 'cause I coulda been in boot camp already in San Diego, California, close to you guys. Should've been cool too, because after boot camp I could've got to meet . I don't know. And anyway, I need to get back in shape and do that, 'cause I was doing well and I just need to get back on the bandwagon so -- I'm going to be here doing this if you are so -- yeah, let's do it. Let's do it, mijo. You're my mijo. I'm your mijo. We're at manos . Let's do it. I'm serious.
