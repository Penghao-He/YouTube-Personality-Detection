Hello, this is my second blog and, um, I've got a computer right here. It's the one from Top Gear -- and the cool one -- and I like it 'cause it's cool, even though it says seriously, I'm cool. 
Do you think you need to be cool to wear it, or is it cool that you aren't wearing it because it says you're uncool, and -- uh, I don't know, it's confusing. And on the label it says, this T shirt was tested on animals -- it didn't fit. Which is funny, and strange, and weird like that. 
Okay. And news about my life. I've been reading this book, Brigands MC, Robert Muchamore. And it's in the series of CHERUB. You can see that there. It's the eleventh one, I think, so it's really good. And it just came out -- came out, like, last Saturday or something. And if you're a teenager and -- you don't have to be a boy -- and, I don't know -- I don't know. If you're -- if you're a girl and you like it just, like, say it or anything. You should read it anyway if you haven't and if you have good for you. 
And, uh, I downloaded this new editing software and I can't understand it. It's called t at b Z S four, and it's really confusing -- I don't get it. There's a link in the sidebar there and it takes thirty seconds to download and then, like, a minute to install. But I don't understand it at all. If anyone can, like, give me a link to a website that tells you how to do it or anything. Now I'm just using Windows Movie Maker because I used to use Sony Vegas Pro, the trial, and then someone said you can download it again but it doesn't work for me. I don't know how you do it. Do you have to like -- I turned off cookies, if that makes a difference. But, I mean, it's just the same. And, yeah, well, if you -- and I -- I don't really wanna buy the real thing because it's five hundred pounds. So that's a bit expensive for editing software I'm gonna use, like, once a week. Well, actually at the moment it's twice a week. So -- and --
Okay, now it's a time when I might get a bit, like, sound a bit nerdy. So if you don't wanna hear anything about this, turn off now and thanks for the view. And, um, so, uh, I -- we just bought HALO: ODST yesterday and it's really good, even though it has no multi player. It has that five point mode which is really good, I think. But, um, yeah, it's really good and I was looking online and preordered Modern Warfare Two. I have game tags in the sidebar, if you wanna look at that. Add me or send me a message or anything or something like that. I'm on Xbox, not PS Three. I just don't like PS Three. It's not as good, I don't think. And I know everyone says oh, you have to pay for internet, but then I mean, like, so? You have to pay for, like everything. You pay for internet anyway email service provider, whatever it's called. It's like, just an extra, whatever it is, like 4 pounds -- 3 pounds a month or something. It's okay. So, whatever. And getting Assassin's Creed Two, which looks really good, and all the new games are coming out. Scribblenauts is another one. Sounds a bit weird, but whatever. So, see you soon.
