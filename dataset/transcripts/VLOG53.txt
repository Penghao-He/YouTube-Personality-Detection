Hi, wazzup? What I been doing, you asked. Thanksgiving was Thursday, obviously, in America and I hope you all had wonderful Thanksgiving. 
And I ate with my family and stuff, so much fun. Then from there I went to Austings house we did back Friday and we stood outside of this local ghetto place that sells hard core drugs, stabbing knives, and stuff, you may know it as Old Navy. We went to Best Buy at three am, got inside, I got World of Warcraft; I got a doo. And then yesterday I got this hat; my dad thought it was a bear, because he's retarded. Also I got some anime, I've been watching a lot of -- I can't even say it Azumanga Daioh , Azumanga Daioh; whatever. I'm cleaning my room right now, I've been cleaning it for like an hour and I'm pretty sure I got an STD from it. I got clitasondria. 
Ow, I very rarely promote myself, I think; I try not to. I changed my twitter name and I ended after the band, you love her because she's dead and it's -- I'll put it in sidebar. So yeah, follow me, because I like stuff. I hope everyone in America had a wonderful vacation and U. K. people, you fucking suck.
