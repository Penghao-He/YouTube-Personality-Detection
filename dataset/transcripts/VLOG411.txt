Hi. um, I'm just wanted to make this video because I went and saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, and I just wanted to talk about it, so here we go. If you haven't seen the movie you might want to stop watching right now. 
So my mum and I go to the movies to see Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. We're going to see the ten o'clock showing, but it was sold out by the time we got there, so we ended up going to the ten forty five show. So we sat there in line for, er, roughly forty five minutes. First of all, it was a really long time and I hate waiting, so hhmm. By the time we get in there, my mum was like oh, go get us a refill, and I'm like, but, but come on, what if it starts without me and stuff like that 'cause it almost did. Um, yeah, and when I was in there, so the first thing I thought was kind of weird was that I was sitting there just -- kind of just sitting there when we first got in there, some random guys just like -- just like walked past, um, the row we were sitting on singing What's My Age Again by Blink one eighty two. I just thought it was kind of weird. So when we gotten -- so we're in the movie, it started, we're all like yay, um, I'm gonna go see Holmes when it comes out, and something else probably. Um, I don't know what else. And, um, so we were watching it um first all, let me just mention that, um, I barely remember any of the sixth book 'cause I read it like last year I think. That is when I finally finished it, um, and it was just so boring. I was just kind of bored 'cause, well, it -- it was -- since it was so long they had so much extra stuff in there that they didn't really need and it's just amazing how they've put all that stuff in two and a-half hour movie that kind of made it better than the seven to eight hundred page book. So, I liked it overall. Um, Tonks hair didn't change color at all in this movie, I'm serious. It normally just, ye, it was like the same color the entire movie. I was not happy. Um, and we've got -- and I guess it's better than the fifth one -- the fifth book. Basically, Harry just whines, sits there and whines and is all mopey and kind of annoying. Um, yeah. So, um, I really did like it. Um, I've said that several times because I really did, and um I -- gosh, I have no clue what to say now. All I know that I really hated about it was that I had to wait in line and we're lucky we got good seats, um, we did, because um, I felt really sorry for the people behind us in line because they had been there like for like forever, but they went to the wrong place to stand in li -- to si -- well they -- they sat outside there and somebody comes over and tells them that they're in the wrong li -- they're not in the line, and ye, I felt sorry for them. Oh my God, what's wrong with my hair today, or okay everyday? I'm just gonna fix my hair. Fixing. Er, come on, my hair. Okay. That did not work. Whatever. Um yeah, so like I said, can't remember rest of the sixth book, but I don't think that entire lo -- I don't think the Lavender and Ron sub plot was actually in the book. I can't remember. I vaguely remember the name Lavender Brown, but not sure where from. Um, but it was very interesting, um, so yeah, not really much else to say there. Um, ye, so I recommend it. Everybody go watch it. Just go see it 'cause it's awesome and you know, awesome. Yeah, so, bye.
