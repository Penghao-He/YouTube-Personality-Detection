Much like this weather, this month has been completely up and down. I mean, yesterday we had torrential rain and today, perfect blue skies. Skies receipt . 
So to start with, I lost my iPod, then I finished school. I went to Cornwall for two weeks and then I decided to go and break my laptop. Aww, sunshine. And then I came back from Cornwall, then I took my laptop to be repaired, then I had my birthday, then I did a twenty four hour coach ride to Spain, spent four days in Spain, had an amazing time, and then spent twenty four hours coming back from Spain on a bus. 
And I found my iPod, then I went to London to see XXXX. Then I stole her glasses and then I started making this video because of the sunshine. So yeah, I went up to London on ooh, hello, on Monday to see XXXX. It was amazing. She's back in Ireland now. And I loved that, and she's the most lovely, lovely person ever, but I stole her glasses. 
So if she'd like to email me, or if anyone wants to email me, just send me an email and I'll email you back to that address and XXXX, I need your address to send these glasses back to you.
