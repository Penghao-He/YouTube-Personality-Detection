Hey YouTube, today is December seventieth, which means it's time for the two thousand and nine project for Awesome. This is the day when YouTube comes together to support some awesome charities. This year my charity is Greenpeace. 
All over the world there is environmental disaster waiting to happen or happening. You've got climate change; you know that whole polar ice thing. You've got endangered species; the panda leaps immediately to mind. You've got deforestation; it's looking pretty bad; but you can make your donation to Greenpeace and I'll change that. 
Greenpeace has been around since nineteen seventy one and they do a lot of amazing work. It's a combination of direct protest, lobbying and research to get things done; and their track record speaks for itself. It's thanks to Greenpeace that we have the international ban on commercial whaling. 
Greenpeace is the one who forces keeping nuclear waste free. Greenpeace can do even more with your help. I'm making a donation this year, haven't figured out how much yet; I don't have that much to give, but I'll give what I can. If you feel the same way .
