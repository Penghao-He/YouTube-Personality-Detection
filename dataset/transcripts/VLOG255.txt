Hey, Guys! How's it going? I am going to make a video, because I am frustrated at something; something that I'm really, really feeling guilty of. Something I'm guilty of and it kind of goes all around the world of everyone being guilty of this. I work at a place, I'm not going to say the name, I work in this place where I make coffee and I serve doughnuts and I do drive through. We make sandwiches. It's just a nice place and its good and it's very famous in Canada. 
 I have issues with some customers and the way they do things. So, the first one is talking to us like we are idiots. We have brains. We know -- we know what you want. You just have to explain it better or speak louder. If we ask you to repeat something, it's not because we want you to change your words around and say oh, let me put this in layman terms for you. Like, I had that when I was on drive through. They weren't speaking very loud. So, I asked politely, could you please repeat your order. And then they start talking to me, like I'm this idiot, just like this. 
 Some people, when I'm at the drive through window and I check out what their order is and I look at the price of what it is and I go, like, hi it's this amount, please. And then, normally I just stick my hand out and they slap it in my hand, okay? There are sometimes when people, just dump it on the counter, like the window ledge counter, when my hand is right there -- out. It's like, hi my hand's here. You can put it in my hand, but no. Would you like me to hand you your coffee the same way, just oh, oh I thought you were going to catch that, oops. 
Another thing is when there some customers who think that I can change the store like moving around where the air vents are, or where the tables are that are stuck to the ground, or how everything is laid out. Yes, because I am at the bottom of the food chain of our working company, like our working line and you are me asking me to figure out how to fix it. That's gonna work. This one lady came in and her complaint was really funny. It was, I just sat on your garbage cans outside and I got gum stuck to my pants. Why were you sitting on the garbage can? I had to hold it together, 'cause I was gonna burst out laughing. 
That was an interesting one but I mean there are things that we do as workers that are good. Like, I'm really good, I've gotten really high marks in, like, customer service. So, I try to please people as much as I can. I'm just a people pleaser, it's what I do. I've-- I've gotten so mad at people I work with who are just being rude. It's just, it's unnecessary for us to be rude to them, even if you're having a stressful day. I mean, everyone comes in expecting good service and I think that we should give them good service. 
Some people, I don't think realize how stressed out, um, you can get when you working in just a fast food restaurant. And how, how it is, it's a hard job. People think like, oh flipping burgers, whatever. No, it's a lot of standing on you feet for a long time and remembering certain things, of how to make things and all the stuff. And it's -- It's a hard job, it's not easy. Um, and we get -- constantly we get stepped on by rude people who just, I guess don't understand. And I was just, I don't know. 
Today, I just feeling like, you know what, something needs to be said. Because, I'm sick of being stepped on; I'm sick of being spat on. I just want to be able to do my job. And if I could reach out to one person; please say thank you. Please say please, it just makes our day better. Trust me, those two words just please and thank you; make everything so much better. 
And if we make a mistake, a slight mistake, like in the order taking and we say, oh, we'll fix it. And we're doing it for free, don't yell at us 'cause we're fixing it for free because we are the ones who made the mistake. We're human; we are not robots and we kinda make mistakes. I don't know. I just wanted to give a little shout out to the underdogs in all of the working industry I guess. 
 Yeah, so I have decided that I really want to make videos more and more. So, I'm trying to think of things to talk about and this one seemed to stand out today. So, let me know what you think. Tell me if you're insulted 'cause I just insulted a bunch of customers who do those things. Or you could tell me about your experiences on the other side or on my side. So, let me know if you've ever worked in a place like that or if you had, like, a really, really rude person behind the counter giving you your order because I have seen them where I work but, only a couple. Most of us are super, super nice. Ugh, I get mad when people are rude behind the counter too because there is no way -- there's no reason for it, really, whatever. Okay, well I'll talk to you guys later, bye.
