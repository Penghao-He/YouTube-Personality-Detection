Alright. Today, we've come together on a very rainy day. It's not just a rainy day, it's raining carrots today. On this very rainy day, it's raining carrots, everywhere in the entire world. People, come together and celebrate the rainy day or carrots. And not only are they happy, they also are a little bit sad because some people don't like carrots. And when it rains carrots, people who don't like carrots are not very happy with it. 
So, most of the people like this day, but a lot of you don't. And, I know it's sad, but you have to make the best out of it. I mean, it's raining carrots and you can't help it so, you should just adjust yourself and start liking carrots because it will be rainy day carrots for a long time. With that I mean, it will be raining carrots for a lot of time. And I have some tips for you if you don't like carrots. Because if you don't like them, you are not happy, as I've said before. Which is kind of illogical, but hey, some people don't know it. 
So my first step is, just stand on a bridge where it does not rain carrots. You should kneel down and say, I like to eat sandwiches with toothpaste on it. From that very moment from when you said that word, that sentence, you will not like carrots, because it makes no sense. However, if -- just start eating carrots against your own will, you might find yourself happy one day, and you look back and you say, hmm, that time when it rained carrots, oh that was a good time. 
You know why it's raining carrots, right? You don't. All right. I was trying to briefly explain why it's raining carrots, but if you don't understand it, then it's not my fault. I mean, I'm not the one who made it up right? Right? Right? Anyways, let's continue. It's raining carrots for just one obvious reason. That obvious reason is, because it's hot in Australia. In Australia the kangaroos hop around with high tech micro sound wave, whatever the hell that may be. The high tech micro sound wave is another word for an mp three -- three player. It plays music, and therefore it started raining carrots in the entire world. So we have to blame the kangaroos in Australia because it's very hot in there. Seriously. We have to.
