All of these right here. And there's more inside my box here. They're all like congratulations on your kid. I'm not going to read them 'cause it's all like -- I can't read the handwriting anyway, and it's a whole bunch of cards from like, oh I'm glad you had a baby girl. Um, I used to be really big on me --
﻿Um, hey YouTube, I'm here for you today to share my memory books. Um, I've taken the liberty of taking everything out of it that I want to share beforehand, so I don't have deal with the edit. 
This is a birthday card for my sixteenth birthday and if you open it up it --
This is my birthday this year that my family got me this card. My sister picked it out. Here's a little but -- a little, uh, button. I'll stick it on my shirt right now. It's a little pin thingy, and you -- and your parents, like, wear it on their shirts? From soccer, from when I was in second grade, that was summer soccer, not YMCA soccer. Um, hang on a second. I realized the webcam was falling, sorry. This is a thing in sixth grade that half the class signed. You pass it around the circle and everybody writes something about you, but it only got halfway through and everything. Um, this is from Megan -- Megan M. Even though you tease me, you are a really great person. 
I like talking soccer with you. Emily says, you are very nice, you definitely have done your New Year's Resolution, you don't give up -- which is funny because I have no clue what my New Year's Resolution was back then. Um, this is from Jason. You are very nice and kind to your softball friends -- yeah, good to know I was kind to everybody. Um, Mary says, you are more of a leader than I'll ever be. I remember reading that like -- um, these are official adoption papers from when I was in eighth grade, we had to do potato babies. On November third I adopted Leopold Emerson. This is a card my friend made me a long time ago. I decided to narrow down what I was going to be showing you a little bit because I'm heading really late into this and I know nobody's gonna wanna watch like a thousand minutes of me doing this. 
Anyway um, right here -- Certificate of Bravery from getting my ears pierced, at Walmart, and what I remember about this is um, my sister got her ears pierced for her second grade birthday, and I really wanted to go with her, but, uh I slept too late and she came out with her ears pierced and I cried really hard about it until my mom agreed me to go get me -- to get my ears -- uh, take me to get my ears pierced, and they, uh pierced my first ear and I cried really hard and screamed and I didn't want to get my other ear pierced.
