Hey, YouTube or just like the couple of people who watch me on this. But that's cool too. Hey guys. Um, I was tagged for this, um, Harry Potter survey in like October two thousand and eight and I did not do it and I have not done it and now I am doing it now. 
Okay, and there's gonna be rapid fire and there's gonna be crazy and spastastic because I am going to try and do it all in one take. And as you guys know, I cannot edit because if anybody out there knows, what editing system works with the Coolpix? Nikon Coolpix P Four BR -- I dunno what all those things mean but Coolpix in this is not the reason I'm posting this. I'm posting this because I want to talk about Harry Potter 'cause who doesn't wanna do that. 
So I've got my list of questions and I've got some Post it notes and some crayons, so let's get down to business, shall we? 
Okay, let's do this. Um, let's just -- fair warning right now. I am probably going to start every question with, why are you making me answer this question because it is physically and mentally and emotionally impossible. 
Okay, number one. What is your favorite wizard rock band? 
Why are you making me answer this question? Um, it really depends on my mood. Um, uh, if I -- if I really wanna dance or something, I'll listen to Ministry of Magic. Um, the Parcelmouths. Um, pretty much those guys. I just love dancing to their music and -- but if I'm feeling really, really fan girly and really romantic kind of mood, I'll listen to Mudbloods or I'll listen to Roon -- Roonil Wazlib. La la. I cannot speak because I'm trying to do this really fast. Um, Neville's Diary. I want to give a shout out to him because I think he is adorable and, yeah, that's all I can think of right off the top of my head. 
Next question. Doodle yoo. How did you get into wizard rock, which is number two? 
I got into wizard rock, uh, I think in my junior year of high school. I'm a senior. That's right, it's at the end of senior year and -- or before that, I'm not exactly sure but my friend Margaret and I -- she really is the one that got me into it. She said, have you heard of Harry and the Potters? So I said, no who are these? They're -- they sound amazing because they have to do with Harry Potter. And she showed me their MySpace and I got really excited and then I clicked on his friends and then their friends and then their friends and then, Team Hoyt and I just kind of swapped notes on who was cool and then it just kind of rolled into this big ball of awesome wizard rock and it -- so happy it happened. Thank you, Team Hoyt, for showing me Harry and the Potters because it never would've gotten as awesome as it is now. Okay. Yeah. 
Number three, have you ever been to a wizard rock concert? 
Yeah. I have. I've only been to one. I'm lame and -- but, I mean at least I've gone to one. Right? Right. And I have their signature. My Post it is folding. Um, it had the Whomping Willows, and, uh, Symatma Jockmill and then , uh, Justin Flinch Fletchley and the Sugar Quills and, uh, Catchlove. So I have all their signatures on the back of a shirt, but since I'm being really quick and random with this video, I won't move from this spot 'cause I don't want this to be over five minutes and if it is, I am very sorry about that. 
Wizard rock concerts are super fun and I need to go to more before I die. Okay. Most played wizard rock song on your iPod. 
 I think it was Save Ginny Weasley. I've listened to that one a lot. Probably because it's the first wizard rock song I've ever heard. Uh, that was a really good song by Harry and the Potters. Um, I think a close second was, uh, Accio Love by Ministry Magic. 
Number five, if you had a wizard rock band, what would it be called? 
Yes. Um, I decided -- 'cause I have made a wizard rock song, but it was really more like the mournings of -- mourning of being a muggle and how much it sucks being a muggle when it -- like, it does if you knew about the wizarding world. Kinda like, Petunia did. But from my point of view and how I wish I could operate and how I wish that I could have a spell check quill before it goes bad and starts making Ronald Weasley come out Roonil Wazlid. Um, anyways, I would've called it, uh, uh, Faith, Trust and Nargle. Like faith, trust in pixie dust, isn't that what Tinkerbell says? But then end it with the Nargles which I don't know if that's stupid or clever. Ha ha. You make up your mind. Put it in the comment side. 
Six, I think I'm on six. Are you a nerd fighter? 
Yes. I am a nerd fighter. Ooh ah. That was a quick one. 
Um, when did you get into Wizard rock? 
I think I already answered that. Um, junior year. Pretty sure, junior year. XXXX, correct me if I'm wrong. But I think you got into it just a little bit before me because you were pretty quick on the draw. Share it with me, I think. Hmm. 
Eight, what is your favorite rock song? 
Um, oh gosh, why are you making me choose? Today my favorite rock song is, um, I dunno know, uh, long dramatic pause, Wizard Rock Heart Throb. I will go with that because I like dancing to that. 
Uh, nine, um, favorite Harry and the Potters song? 
I really like These Days are Dark. Even though it, like -- it's really long and it's one of their longer ones. I could say it's one of their longest songs. I just -- I love it and it's really upbeat and it just makes me get butterflies inside and makes me extremely happy. Just like penguins on my cheeks. Yes. Okay. 
Current favorite song/band -- I dunno where to put this. 
Um, current favorite song/band? My current favorite band is, hm, probably the Mudbloods and my current favorite song from them -- I'm just gonna pick from them, is, um, Be my Witcher. Yeah. That song. It's so cute and it's so upbeat and I just love rocking out to it and, um, rock with a W. And -- and sexual innuendos and, yes. Great stuff right there. 
Eleven, greatest lo -- line from a rock song? 
Mm, I really like Insufferable know it all, Hermione Granger because that's -- that's a lot of syllables to fit into one line and to make it work. Good job, Gred and Forge. You guys are awesome. That's what I'm going to pick right now. 
Um, favorite dance song? 
Probably Here in your Car, by the Ministry of Magic because, um, XXXX and I have, like, dance moves to it and, uh, it's really upbeat. 
Uh, okay. Favorite song to sing along to? 
Where is this going to go? Oh my gosh, right there. I don't know if you can see my eyes or if that's important or if this will stay. Favorite song to sing along to. Oh my gosh. I think I'm getting a call. Ignore that because I'm covered in penguin. Um, my favorite song to sing along to. Oh, uh, I Heart Weasleys by the Ministry of Magic. This is just like the Ministry of Magic fan girl time isn't it? 
Um, and favorite ship song? 
I'm gonna just co -- um, I'm just going to totally, um, pull one out of the hat here because I just think it's so cute. It's, uh, by the Owl Post and it's, uh, Different Kind of Magic. It's about Lily and James and it's so cute and it makes me so happy and, uh, it's great. Also, there's one from Neville's Diary that is just kind of a funny one that is him and, um, Madame Pomfrey -- no Madame Sprout. Oh gosh, Pomona Sprout? Yeah, so Madame Sprout. Why Madame Pomfrey? Uh, okay. 
So anyways those are my lovely answers to the wizard rock survey. I hope this is quick, I hope it was entertaining and -- oh my gosh, I would walk five hundred miles and I would walk five hundred more.
