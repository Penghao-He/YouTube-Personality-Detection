Today I would like to bring you a motivational speech from the regions of Waco, America. A short time ago in a county not too far away I addressed you, the YouTube community, by way of an over eloquent vernacular. I again wish to do so and would ask that you continue to view this video to hear the rest of the speech. 
War on Terror, an almost trite declaration by the US Government in this day and age, begs the question as to how they will fight such a war on terror. With little Suzie terrified of tarantulas and thirty year old Marvin still concerned about what life is like outside of his mother's household, it is a wonder how the service men and women of our country can take on such a giant as terror. 
I, however, would like to offer a solution. And to those of you chemistry folk, by solution I do not mean a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, but rather an answer to an enduring question within the confines of American society. We must begin by creating an altruistic society in which the people do not think for themselves. By controlling the thoughts and minds of Americans through outlets such as CNN and Fox News and -- and/or the National Enquirer, we will discover that terror only exists in our minds. 
Once people are no longer thinking for themselves, we should initiate a false war on terror, on horror, on love, and other emotions that could at one point or another inflict pain on a humanoid. Accomplishing these things would do wonders for the society that we live in today. And by wonders, I do not mean things that happened in the Old Testament or the Bible, but rather a strange unity amongst the people, considering the fact that they're being controlled by the same outlet. 
With that I conclude my antagonizing and otherworldly speech. Take what you like, leave what you hate, for this is the American idea of hope, change, and something else that I can't remember.
