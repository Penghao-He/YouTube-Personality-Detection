Hello. I hope this works, because I'm doing this -- this YouTube record from webcam feature and it's going to be real fun because I only have one take to do now. Not because of the YouTube feature, because of something else. So, let's get straight into it. 
I got a package today. It's from XXXX. And I got -- first of all, I got this book. It's called Little Brother and I think she's mentioned it on the -- on some videos, I think at least one. Yeah, I'm just gonna read it when I have some time. It sounds really, really cool and interesting, then I'm gonna read it, I'm gonna do a review or something, yeah. But that's not all. You know she told you that we're doing this, this Chocolate Oreo exchange now which I am really, really, uh, which I appreciate a lot. Uh, so you can see those are the cookies. I've never seen them, I've never tried them, and I will now because I said I would try them first on video-- live -- on tape, so to speak. So let's go. First of all, this opening thing here is pretty, pretty cool. We don't have that, and I can't get it open. Brilliant. Ah. There we go. I'm glad first of all they're still in one piece. I had thought they were -- would be crashed to death by, I don't know, travelling the Atlantic, but they're okay, you see. Apparently, apparently that's an Oreo, see? It says here Oreo, which would make a lot of sense. Yeah. 
I read on the internet -- I went on Wikipedia page to -- to look them up, which is a weird thing to do for cookies, but I did. And I heard that it's a pretty fun thing to pull them apart so let's do it. It works, great. They smell great. Okay, this is it, then. I hope they're good. 
Ah, I totally know what you guys mean. What the hell? Mm. I was so scared -- I'm just gonna talk with my mouth full because it's funny -- I was so scared that they'd be, you know, not delicious. And I was like, what am I gonna say? This is not even relevant right now. They're awesome. Thanks, Laura! You know, ice cream, all that -- I can't do with my hands. I'm not gonna even try it. You know what I mean. So yes, very cool, very cool. 
I hope everybody has a nice day. My happiness is going up now because I'm eating chocolate and Oreos. Actually, not chocolate, what am I saying -- just Oreos. Mmm. I should really wait and not eat them all at once. They're so good. Wow. I think I'm addicted. Mmm, yeah, sorry, I don't have time anymore. I have to eat. So yes, I -- I don't have to tell you the whole story because Laura did already so I can just eat Oreos now. Cool, mmm hmm. I think I like that. Bye! Let me stop this.
