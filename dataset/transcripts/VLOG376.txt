Okay, people don't seem to understand I have a love for Britney Spears that's equal to or greater than Chris Crocker's love for Britney Spears. Like, I will defend her 'til the day I die because she's an amazing person. So I love her, love her. 
My favorite insults are, like, dickhead and douchebag, which brings out a manly insult in guys. 
Is it wrong that I'm completely in love with a gay fourteen year old boy? Well he's not technically gay, I just tell him that he is. I just say that, I'm not like a big fan of Jonas Brothers, like I used to enjoy them and now I don't. But if you are Jonas brothers fan, how can you like anybody except for Joe? Like, those fourteen year old girls who like Nick - I don't get them. What does he bring to the table, just -- he doesn't talk and he's shy and he's awkward and when he does talk he's either like competitive or just arrogant. And Joe Jonas is funny. He's funny. And Kevin --
My hair is long like the whore's ways. I'm a whore. You guys know that. All of you know it. Lots of you know it. 
Oh my God, I found this random clip in my camera. I have no idea where it came from or why I was recording. Maybe I didn't know I was recording, but I found it.
