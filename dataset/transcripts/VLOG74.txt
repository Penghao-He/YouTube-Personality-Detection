Hey everyone, here. Um, I'm just letting you guys know, um, for those of you who aren't, like, aware yet, um, I didn't make a new channel, which you guys should totally check out. Um, it's called XXXX, it's all about makeup tutorials, hair tutorials, reviews, um, and just like all that beauty stuff, 'cause I've been getting a lot of requests for makeup tutorials and just stuff like that. 
I think I have two videos already posted on there. One's a review for a Chi hair straightener, and the other one's, um, a tutorial on how to do your hair with the Chi, and, um -- yeah, go check it out. I'll put a link in the sidebar, and I hope you guys subscribe, and so from now on, um, all of my beauty videos that everyone's been requesting me, will be on that channel -- from now on. And this channel will just be for, like, my blogging stuff. So go and subscribe to that, and if you want, and --. That's it. Thank you so.
