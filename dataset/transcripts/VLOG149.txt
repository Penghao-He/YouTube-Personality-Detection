Merry Christmas, YouTube. Ah, I just want to stop by really quick to say Merry Christmas to all of you. And, ah, Merry Christmas, got some ah, cool presents. Nice gift cards, ah, awesome clothes and the Wii fit balance board thingy, it's sweet. I love playing on it; doing some jogging and skiing and stuff, yeah. So, quick Christmas story. On the twenty third, I have yet to do any Christmas shopping; I know that's bad. So, I went to get my mom a ham. She asked me to get her a ham. I'm like sure, whatever. I go pick up a ham, really quick. It was not really quick, at all. That's the line that was there. I had to wait an hour outside for ham, ham. I hate ham. I don't even like it any more. I use to -- I used to love honey baked ham. Now, I don't. I hate honey baked ham. 
And a quick shout out, um, to a specific someone who knows who they are; who gave me a really-- or who rather made my Christmas Eve really, really good. So, thank you and Merry Christmas and ba bye.
