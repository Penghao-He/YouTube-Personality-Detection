Hey there. You see I get haunted and a certain thing was stopping my door from opening and I thought I would never get into the house, but it's all, like, it hit and it went dunk and it hit -- hit something that was blocking it between the wall. 
Third doubt, the package included this T shirt I'm wearing. Oh yeah, this machine pose news and this CD by Hank Green . Hoh, hoh, square and nerdy just how we like it. The CD is -- was in my computer. Hank Green; the song, . This isn't Hogwarts. 
Somewhere out, go fish, I know mules are so half ass, , protons and neutrons, dead boys girlfriend, demolition derby, fathers of the family fathers, , Jesus gets nothing for Christmas, vegetables and it all makes senses in the end. 
As well as a T shirt I preordered, I got signed pick, yeah tha -- tha -- tha -- that is one hundred percent Hank's signature. Yeah, it can go with my other pick. In fact I am going to introduce my picks as friends now. You know I love it. 
I have seemed to miss placed my wallet. And it must have contained my pick ah, ah, wallet and spoon. All right, okay. Introducing picks into a new habitat. Do do do do do, Offspring pick meet Hank pick. Hank pick, Offspring pick, like each other. I now have a total of three picks, one of them I seem to can't find. eh, ha yeah, I mean yeah, it's Hank's signed. I mean tha -- tha -- that's, like, Hank Green's his signature right there. And last but certainly not least -- why am I speaking Russian? Or Russian accent anyway. Whatever. We have a -- oh no wait that's how I say it. We have a haaaa, poster of Hank with Shark Eyed Jones art on the back along with lyrics. Well, you know I've been doing a lot of magic tricks recently. I want to try one with you guys. So, see look, you know, it's a Hank poster, a Hank poster. I mean, I have -- I have Hank on my wall now. 
Right, well, on a slightly sadder note, I'm leaving YouTube. Not permanently, don't worry; just this channel. But I want to do -- this is going to be my last video on this channel and then I'm -- I'm going to make a new channel 'cause of all the haters. This channel, it could get watched it could get commented. I'm going to put all of them to my spam e mail address, so I will never know. This channel is going to sit here and die while a new channel will rise up. I will continue in the XXX , I'm still going to be a XXXX, XXXX; I'm still part of that. I'm still going to do everything with XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and everyone. I'm just going under a new name 'cause I'm sick of the haters because I'm allowed to have and opinion. I'm still a person. I maybe only 14, but that still makes me a legal person. I might not be and adult, still I say person, so you know. For all the people that matter, I'm going tell you my new channel. Most of them, I'll see you at school, but you know? I've got -- ah, if you want my new channel just hear me. I -- I'll still be using this one for another two weeks for that kind of stuff, but most of the people I'm just going to send it out to my subscribers and uh, my friends, people at school, people who watch me, you know? I'm not going to put any links to my new channel in this one because all of the haters will just swing to there. I'm just sick of it. I'm just sick of the haters. I mean, so what if I write on Twilight. I don't like it. Although I'm going to see the film, the new one, because I don't want people to say, ah, stop judging it before you've seen it. I'm going to see it and then I'm going to judge it. Okay? I'm going to see it. So you know it, this is the end. is dead as of this moment.
