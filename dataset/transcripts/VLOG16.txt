Hi. My name is XXXX and I am the Idea Storm Manager at XXXX and I'm really excited to share something new with you today. XXXX has done Idea Storm for almost three years now. It has been an amazing, open crowd, sourcing concept for us and we generate over thirteen thousand ideas from the community. What we're doing now is taking it to the next level and we're adding a new section on the site called storm sessions. Storm sessions can best be described as targeted, relevant and time map ideas generating session. Let me tell you how it works. First Dell will initiate a storm session around the targeted topic that is relevant to our current business meetings. Then we want you, the community to post your ideas, to vote in common on ideas and basically to tell us what you think we should be doing on this topic. Then, the critical part of this is that we actually time map it so that we will close the session and start accepting ideas or votes. This is important so that we can review the information and create action plans based on your ideas. And finally we will come back and share with you exactly when and how we'll put these ideas into action. I'm really excited about this. We have two great sessions ready for launch and many, many more to come. So check it out today. Check it out in the future and tell us what you think we should be doing. Thank you.
