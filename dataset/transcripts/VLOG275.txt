The bar I'm gonna talk about today is Train Bar. Um, also called Mistral Bleu. Um, it's -- it's in Roppongi. Um, basically to get there from Roppongi Crossing is you walk down towards -- depending on the side of the street you walk on, you walk down towards either McDonalds or Donki Hordo . Um, basically, it's right at McDonalds, then there's a tiny little street and then you're -- if you cross that tiny little street, uh, you see some stairs going down and Train Bar is -- is in the wall right next to those stairs. Uh, that sounds maybe a little difficult but it's -- it is quite easy to find. Ask anyone for, uh, um, yeah, uh where McDonalds is and, uh, you should pretty much see it. 
Um, Train Bar is a rock bar. Uh, it's really tiny. It's one of the -- I think it's the only rock bar really in, uh, in Roppongi -- at least I haven't found any else. And, uh, I haven't heard about any else and generally, there's not that many up in Tokyo. Um, so they only play rock music. Uh, heavy rock, metal, um, some kind of -- some -- sometimes the old rock. Basically, anything in the rock genre. Um, it's -- it's very small, uh, but can get very busy. Um, in general, the crowd is a little bit older. Uh, I'd say in general, people are plus thirty. Not saying young people don't go in. They do, but they definitely don't make out the majority. As also, in general -- I'm speaking in very general terms here -- in general, the crowd is more men than women. Um, and I think both fit, just because, you know, uh, old style rock music -- so it has an older crowd. Uh, and in general -- in my experience at least, uh, rock music, especially the older kind, was more of a guy thing than a girl thing, in very, very general terms. Uh, so that might explain it. 
Uh, ironically, it's a rock bar but you find a lot of high end people there. Uh, usually people with, uh, with quite good jobs and even people taking out business partners for a drink in the night and stuff like that. I definitely made some -- some very good contacts there. Um, fights pretty much never happens. Uh, I've heard about them one or two times, never seen them and I go there a lot. Uh, I'd say, you know, it's a once in a full moon, uh, kinda thing. It'll happen, maybe a small fight every year, you know, maybe a couple of times every year or something like that. 
Uh, the crowd are usually very cool, very friendly. It's definitely a meet people kind of spot. People are very easy to talk to. Um, the only -- the -- one of the down sides is though that since it's so tiny, it only takes one person to fuck it up for everyone else. If one person is being a loud idiot who runs around doing stupid shit and is generally very annoying, you can't really move away from him, you know, even if you go down to the other end of the bar. He's still very, very much, you know, doing stuff to your experience, so that's perhaps one of the only downsides. Um, when it gets crowded and when not -- I can't say when. Of course, in general on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday are more crowded than, um, the other days. 
When it's open? It's usually open every day, sometimes Sundays closed. And, um, of course on special holidays and stuff like that. It usually opens around, uh, five or six in the -- uh, six or seven in the evening, roughly. Again, but that also depends. It's pretty much when the owner or whoever works on that day decides they want to open. Staff -- very, very cool people, by the way. Um, you will find a healthy mix of both Japanese and, um, foreigners. Uh, sometimes more foreigners, sometimes more Japanese. I'd say it's roughly fifty fifty. 
Um, the prices is fairly cheap compared to places in Roppongi. It's definitely one of the cheaper places in Roppongi. Uh, beer and such start at seven hundred yen and pretty much nothing goes over a thousand yen. Uh, the only prices that go over a thousand yen are things like a bottle of red wine or champagne, things like that. Uh, but in general, they're pretty cheap. Uh, from five to nine thirty is happy hour. Or is it eight thirty? Now, nine thirty, I'm pretty sure. Um, or is it just nine? Anyway you get the general -- nine ish, uh, it's happy hour which means, uh, all drinks are five hundred yen, which is super cheap, uh, in Roppongi. So that's definitely a good spot to warm up. Uh, they also, um, they have a bell that you can ring. If you ring it, you buy shots for everyone at the bar. Usually, I would not recommend doing that if it's a full night. Um, shots are usually around eight hundred yen, by the way. 
Um, they have a very healthy music selection and feel free to request songs. Go over and browse through their -- they have pretty much huge wall section uh for -- for CDs. You can also bring in your own CDs and stuff like that, as long as obviously the music kind of fits. Uh, you won't hear any Britney Spears, I'm sorry. Um, the -- the bar has a very long history. Uh, it's pretty much always been in the same family. The owner's Indian. His name's Roy -- very cool guy. Um, and it's been his -- been in his family from the beginning. I think it's around thirty years now and have been visited by a lot of rock bands, rock crews and stuff like that after concerts and stuff like that, which is a very nice to happen. 
Um, they definitely have a lot of regulars. Oh, I'd say regulars make up eighty percent of the people that are usually there. There's not that many tourists because it's -- it's usually not in tourists -- uh, it's usually not in tourist books. Uh, it has been a couple of times though, but in general is not. Uh, which is a shame, it's really cool. Um, yeah, so, uh, but I definitely -- you know, should I rank it? Should I rank it from -- um, on a -- on a one to ten? Depending on what you're in the mood for, you know, it would be perfect. Other times, it's just not. Um, I don't want to give anything a ten so I'd -- I'd give it an eight or nine, you know. Pretty -- pretty damn good. I recommend it if, uh, if you like rock music. If you don't, then it might not be so much your place. Anyway, um, so if you're in Roppongi, check out Train Bar. It's a cool place.
