Hello everybody on my YouTube list. Today we have something very special. Im doing SS report 'cause I had no other name. The SS report today is very special. It's Thanksgiving. Today is the day we all give thanks to the things that matter most. And right the things that matter most are my fans. I'd just like to give a shout out to all the wonderful people. Now there's so many people that I can't name you all on one video, it would take about maybe two or three because you guys are just awesome. I want you guys to know that I appreciate everything you've brought me through. Now if you can hear, there's Christmas music playing in the background. There's a reason for that. That's part two of this video. I want you guys to know that you guys have brought me so far and I give thanks for that. Also I give thanks for all the people in the US of A and all the people across seas and everyone who's a part of this community and is so helpful and supportive to YouTube members. I give thanks to you. I also give thanks to family. If you have a family, I have a family, give thanks to them. I give thanks to family. So that's fans, people on the globe and family. Another thing I would have to give thanks for is all those haters because when I get haters, I've noticed that it rises my population. I don't say I want to keep having haters but thank you so I have to show you some love. I would also like to thank the Internet for providing Twitter. Twitter's amazing. I'd also like to thank -- I'd like to thank the people at Blizzard. They've finally found a way to screw up World of Warcraft even worse. Thank you. Not only would I like to thank Blizzard and everybody else I just mentioned, I would also like to thank the people behind Microsoft. Updating to Windows Seven, it's a pretty good idea. Then again, everybody is practically switching to a Mac. I'm on PC and I love it. Now, why the Christmas music is playing and was playing in the background. Let's talk about something. People, obviously it's Christmas time -- well it will be Christmas time come next week. Tuesday of next week will be December first and twenty five days, we'll be counting. Twenty five miserable days because on that twenty fifth day, it's all happiness. Well I guess some people do Christmas Eve. So maybe it's twenty three days actually so I should have said twenty four days at the beginning. Now I know that all my fans out there are excited for Christmas and if you don't celebrate Christmas for any reason or if you're not a Christmas person, happy holidays still and I want you to enjoy this month that we don't get any winter in or snow, so --. But it will be very cool. It's ironic, there's all this cold but no snow. Now, not to mention that, I want everybody to do their best. I want everybody to have a safe, um, time. Have a fun time. And black Friday's this Friday, you can get a lot of savings. Save a lot. I think that's when everybody's going to do their Christmas shopping. Then again, black Friday's dangerous 'cause you know people get injured and trampled and stuff like that. It's happened before people. So be careful if you plan on going out for black Friday and, uh, you know, make -- just make sure that you guys just have fun. Keep coming back.
