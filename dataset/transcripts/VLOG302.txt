Hello, XXXX viewers and XXXX people. How are you guys doing today? I'm doing great, thanks. 
Finals is next week and that's gonna suck, but we have two days off, yay, because we have Martin Luther King's Day and then school recess on Friday, so we have three days of school. That's going to be great. 
Yeah, and um, so everyone say hi to Bernard again. He's not going to say anything today, because he's shy. Yeah, he changes. He has a cute little green bow. 
Anyways, I have this cool collage that I made out of chairs, or pictures of chairs. It's in the shape of a cup, if you couldn't tell. And it's cool because it's for my Spanish project. It's part of my Spanish project because I'm doing a presentation on Pablo Picasso. Yeah, he was the first person to introduce collage into fine art, so that's my realia . 
So, what else? Oh, we're going to change XXXX, we're going to have two weeks of the same people now because half our people can't do videos. So that's going to be XXXX on Monday, me on Tuesdays, XXXX on -- wait, XXXX on Wednesday, XXXX on Thursday, and XXXX on Friday. So it's not that big of a change, except we're going to do -- you're going to see us twice a month instead of once so that's going to be awesome, yeah. 
And, oh, school updates; um, I have to set Nick up on a blind date, and um he knows practically every single girl in the school and every guy in the school and everyone knows him so I don't know how that's going to happen. Blah, so yeah. 
Um, oh, there's this new girl named XXXX, uh yeah, and she's there, and I'm just so mean. I'm not going to put -- go into specifics. 
Oh, I'm going to put my, um, link in the sidebar so you can go check out my personal channel and I have video up about XXXX so you can see why he's in all my videos. 'Cause he's so cute, isn't he? And I actually have two channels. One for my shit videos and then one for my boring videos. So I don't make good videos, period. Yeah, so I'm going to put both links in that bar, unless it's on the side, but I'm pretty sure it's on this side. So, bye.
