I'm ill, so I haven't really being doing anything at all. I have been at home, all day, for like the past six days. I've been off for six days. It's awful, but -- I have a cough, but, I just like, have a general flu -- because my hair is really bad. And I just, I' m really sorry, I haven't been making any videos, I've been just so distracted. A lot has happened, but I'm really sorry, and I'm going to get back into making all of them again. I think I've become a bit shy talking to myself. 
Can you see XXXX? Tell us, someone. hold it there so I can see you from in the camera. Okay. You know, shag bands are the new --
What is that? I don't really know what yellow means. I think yellow means hug and green means blow drying. That was my sister by the way. 
So typically XXXX has challenged me to do a workout video. However, she also left me three alternative challenges on my page. If you don't believe me, go to the page, I think it's up there, click on my name, or maybe it's there, click on my name, up there. Yeah. The other three alternatives, there was a news report about caterpillars which I was going to do - funny story, I'll tell you later. Or a music video and I've decided to do the music video. And I'm going to do a remake of XXXX. And I will post it and eventually you will see it. I need to give XXXX a challenge because she's been buzzing me so much. I say challenge you like. No, not that challenge. Okay, what other challenge? No, no, I can't do that challenge, give me another one. So I've decided on this video, they've plastered on this video and you can't change this XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, your challenge is here. Your challenge, XXXX, is to do a dance video like, how to dance and then do dances to a song, you know. . Now we're going to get down. 
Hello, girls I am your Russian instructor for ballet.
