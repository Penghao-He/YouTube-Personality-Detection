Hello, what can I get for you? 
Chai tea. 
Sure. What size? 
Uhh, large. 
All Right; for here or to go? 
For here. 
All right, that will be three ninety five. 
Three ninety five? Oh I also want a muffin, carrot raisin brain. 
All right, so that will be five ninety five. 
Where's my drink? 
Oh, it's right here. 
This is not what I ordered. I ordered Chai tea. 
Yes, it is. 
No, I don't want this. Where's the tea bag? 
Oh, we don't have Chai tea like that. It's a concentrate that we make from steamed milk --
I didn't ask for that! This is great, just great, thank you, thanks a lot. Came in here, I ordered Chai tea. This is not what I wanted. You people, you people. 
Listen, I'm really sorry. It was just a misunderstanding I can-- I can give you a refund if you just give me --
No! You know what, Fuck you, fuck you people
Oh, what was that? Didn't he want his drink? 
No. There was -- there was a misunderstanding. 
Thanks a lot, you made me make that drink for nothing. 
Please doesn't talk to me like that. 
Well, I'm not the one that made that customer mad.
