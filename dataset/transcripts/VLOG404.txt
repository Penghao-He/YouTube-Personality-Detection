What's up guys? It's Friday, and I have to tell you guys about this song that has been stuck in my head. Let's see -- how did it go? So I put my hands up, they're playing my song. The butterflies fly away -- no wait that wasn't it. Um, what was it, something like, ponyo, ponyo, ponyo tiny little fish, she's a little fish in the deep blue sea. Yeah, that sounds much better, right? 
For those of you who haven't heard it, it is a new movie from Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki, who is amazing; pure, pure amazing talent that is hard to come by even in the animation industry, when you had people from Disney and all that stuff. He is just so amazing. Now if you have heard of it, you most likely have heard that Noa Cyrus, who is Miley's little sister, and Frankie Jonas, the bonus Jonas, are doing voices in the movie; which for some of you I know out there is like amazing -- oh my God, like oh my God, it's Frankie Jonas -- but for some of you, you might not see it because of that, because it's another movie from Disney that, oh it's another Cyrus, it's another Jonas and stuff like that, so you might not go and see it. 
Here is where I hope you find a turning point. First of all, they are not the only voices in the movie. You have Tina Faye and Liam Neeson are also big voices that are in it, and that is pure amazing. I love the both of them; I love Liam Neeson as an actor, he is amazing. Second of all, it's not your average Disney movie. Some of you might recognize the name Miyazaki from the movie Spirited Away, which is another one of his works, which became really popular in the United States. 
The thing is is they all start in Japan because he is a Japanese artist and he works in Japan. All the movies he makes start in Japan. The only reason they have the Disney tag on them is because the Disney company is the one who produces them for the United States into an English version; they do the English dubbing over them and then distribute them into the U. S. ; that's the only reason that they have the Disney dub on them. So it's not an average Disney movie. 
We all have to admit that Disney movies are very good, especially a lot of the animated ones, but if you're not big into all that Disney stuff, this really isn't a Disney movie. It is done in Japan and it is done by one of the greatest animators and story writers ever, in my opinion; so that's another reason. 
Other movies that have been done by Hayao Miyazaki which I love include Porco Rosso, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Winds, Spirited Away; like I said; Howl's Moving Castle; and Princess Mononoke and one of my favorites, My Neighbor Totoro. That's another thing is My Neighbor Totoro along with Ponyo are two movies that look like they are made for children, which is true. Hayao Miyazaki focuses on movies that are made for children; more -- like more or less. He does. But the thing is I got into these movies when I was about sixteen. I was sixteen when I first saw my first Miyazaki movie and I fell in love with it; and I did I fell in love with everyone I saw. The first one I saw was Howl's Moving Castle, which has one of my favorite actors as a voice actor, Christian Bale. Oh my gosh, and it was amazing. It is so good and it is just really great. And that's one of those ones where it's kind of not really like just a children's story; like, as a teenager, as an adult, you can even appreciate it. Trust me. 
And that's how a lot of his movies are; like Spirited Away was one; Princess Mononoke is another one of those; Nausicaa and the Valley of the Winds, Porco Rosso -- kind of have a deeper sort of story going to them that older minds can appreciate it. Even My Neighbor Totoro, being a sort of children friendly movie because it has a little -- the characters are very young, which they're, um, voiced by Dakota Fanning and her younger sister, whose name currently escapes me, but even so, it's just a -- it's a heartwarming story that you see in that film that any age can really appreciate it. Also, Totoro is this big giant forest spirit who is absolutely adorable, but then again, I'm a girl and I say adorable way too many times per day. It's awful. 
So that's what I'm expecting from Ponyo, I've seen the trailers; it looks like typical Miyazaki which is fantastic. It looks very child oriented because you have younger main characters, which is what he usually has. Anyways, they're usually younger if they're not children; they're more teenagers, I -- I would say. They look like they're in their teens. There is one that is definitely an adult, more or less. But even so, even though it has younger children as the more, like, the protagonist in this movie, it looks like it's gonna have that more serious storyline to it that anyone can appreciate it, children and adults alike. Because you know there are going to be a lot of adults that are taking their children to go see this, but I think they won't be disappointed. And trust me, no matter what age you are, you more than likely will not be disappointed. 
Miyazaki is such a great story teller, a great animator; like the animation is always superb and it's just so good and I really really say go see it. I'm going to see it as soon as possible. That most likely won't be today, even though it comes out today, but I'm gonna go and see it as soon as I can. And you know who else says you should go and see it? Totoro. Totoro says you should go see it. Yeah, this is how much I love this movie, I have a Totoro pillow. Totoro says you should go see it and so do I. So go see it. 
And if you think for one second I'm being paid to do this, you've got to be kidding me. I am not that popular on YouTube; are you kidding me? I just do these silly little vlogs; I am not being paid to do this. That is absolutely ridiculous. I'm just doing this because I wanted to do a vlog because I haven't done one in 10 days. And because, you know, with Ponyo coming out today, I wanted to talk about something that I love, which is Miyazaki and his movies; like, they're just -- they're so good, I really love them. And I'm not kidding when I say that no matter what age, you can appreciate them. The friend that gave them to me to borrow to watch is my age, and he still watches them and he still loves them. And they're just -- they're really good. Trust me. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, I will apologize. I know, I know, like, this certain animation might not fit everyone's styles, but if you really do like his stuff, you won't be disappointed. They're always very well done and I'm so excited that there is finally another Miyazaki movie, because I was hoping and waiting for it to come out. So I'm very excited. 
So you should go see it if you get the chance, just -- just see it. Okay, I'm done, I'm done; this vlog is done. Bye.
