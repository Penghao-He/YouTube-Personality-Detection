-- and continues to be popular today. And if you wanna know why he's called Uncle Milton -- that's actually the, uh, real name that he goes by now -- it's because this is a bad joke, so don't blame me, but he says that he was in charge of all the ants, so then he must be the uncle. All right. I was coming to, um, a second question and that would be from Adwena in Edmonton. And she asks, um, "I heard that when you buy an ant farm it doesn't come with the ants, that you have to get them later? " Well, that's true, but you know what? You don't have to get the ants yourself. You can actually send away for them. I believe all ant farms come with a certificate that you send in the mail, and then a few weeks later you get a plastic vile of about 30 ants. Now, if you want to know where those ants come from, there's actual jobs -- uh, careers, if you will -- of people who are calling themselves ant catchers. And they pay about a little bit over a penny or a cent, or, depending on what country you're from, maybe a couple of pesos -- I'm not too sure -- uh, for an ant. And it takes about ten hours to gather fifty thousand ants. So if that a career you want to get into, contact Uncle Milton, 'cause, uh, maybe he could get you a job in ants. I guess that would be ant ranching. Ant harvesting? I don't know, but there is a job out there for you if you want it. 
All right, last question is from, uh, Francis in Fort Collins, Colorado, and he asks, "Why would anyone be interested in ant farms? " Well, obviously a lot of people are interested in ant farms, Francis, or else it wouldn't be a really popular toy. But I don't want a philosophical point of view on this. You remember that little show called Survivor that was real famous? Popular? I'm sure you watched it, Francis. That -- that's your answer. All right? . We have our own little TV shows that could be metaphorical ant farms, when you think about it. Like, all those reality based shows are pretty much just human ant farms, don't you think? All right. Think about that one for a while. 
That's it for XXXX this week. Go ahead and e mail me your suggestions, questions or thoughts. Maybe you'd like to send in a photo of your own ant gallery, your ants' farm or your aunts and uncles -- who knows? Go ahead and send them my way and, uh, I'll be really appreciative. And, who knows; maybe I'll get an ant farm myself. 
ï»¿And welcome to XXXX, this is something we do every week on web waste world. We pick a topic, answer your question on that topic and you're so much smarter for it that you thank us in your will. All right, so the topic is on ant farms. Let's go ahead and get into the first question from Patsy in Plainfield, Connecticut and she asks who invented ant farms and why? Good question. Not a lot of people know the answer to this but I found out and of course, it's the guy named Milton Levine. Nineteen fifties, he was a distributer of, ah, novelties gag items including spud guns and rubber shrunken heads. And he wanted to actually widen his merchandise and all of the sudden he came up with this great idea. In nineteen fifty six, he went to a picnic with his family and noticed how little kids love to put ants in Mason jars with dirt and then watch them dig tunnels and sure enough he decided --
