Hi there. Um, it's been a while. Yeah, um, I haven't been around for a long time as you can probably tell. Um, my last video was about two weeks, so um, I just want to let everyone to know I'm still -- I'm still here. I'm still around so don't get any ideas that I'm -- I'm gone which I haven't. 
Um, well I can actually um, explain the reasons why I haven't been around. Um, probably one of the main reasons is because I have been suffering from a bad cold which is a bit annoying and obviously I don't want to make videos while I'm a bit poorly, so, um, I had to leave for a couple of weeks. Uh, so, it's probably a reason why I haven't been around lately. 
Um, of course, uh, I posted up the um, the top ten Chelsea goals um, yesterday uh, which I wanted to do because um, because I was just literally watching um, primary league videos um, for a couple of days. It just gave me a bit of uh, interesting thing to -- do something like that so. Um, I've gotten a couple of comments so um. 
Another thing. Uh, I've got 200 subscribers which is really good. Um, I'm actually quite flattered that I've got two hundred subscribers now and so yeah. I've come a long way. I've come a long, long way. It's um, I'm quite pleased about that. Uh, so I'm, yeah. I'm -- I'm really flattered. 
Everyone writes on my Swedish lesson videos and think I get a lot of comments about that. My first -- my first Swedish lesson has gotten loads and loads of comments and viewers and I'm really, I'm quite flattered about that. So thank you very, very much for commenting and thank you very much for uh, your views and your um, ratings. So keep commenting and rating those videos and I hope you get a lot of use out of them. Uh, I hope there'll be a new one coming very soon if I'm still alive. If I'm still -- if I'm still good. 
Um, I have one more question that I need to ask, and that's the Becker thing. Um, yeah, um, basically I wanted to ask you something. Um, if you -- if you could make a video about it that would be even better. Um, I was wondering if you -- if you knew any ornaments, any Swedish ornaments um, I've got one right here. You probably already know what this is if you can actually see it. I'm not sure, but whatever. This is a balicarian horse. It's obviously a very Swedish horse and I bought it when I was in Stockholm last year. Um, I bought it for a hundred forty nine Swedish Kroner I think. Um, and it's been sitting over there on my desk with the Swedish flag on top of it. Um, it's my sort of little -- little Swedish shrine box. 
I want to ask Becker if she knows any other ornaments that are collectable from Sweden um, because I -- I really like the Swedish ornaments. Um, so if you could make a video about it that would be fantastic. Um, but um, normally -- but you're -- going videos I think. Um, a lot of other things, so it will be difficult for you to get a chance to but um, no worries and just do it when you get a chance and um, yeah. 
So that's all I need to say, um, because I haven't been here in a while and um, and I need to update you guys on everything that has been going on. So um, there will be a couple of videos from me soon. Um, I am still around. I am not gone um, just that I have been suffering from a cold lately and it's a bit shit. Um, so yeah. 
Um so, I want to say, guys um, that you're enjoying your summer and yep, bye.
