I'm talking like this 'cause . This is for us to video. I don't know what that is. I don't know what to say. Think it's in the sidebar. Do you think we're going in the right direction? The reason I'm supporting -- I'm not quite sure really if what they're doing -- I mean -- is a charity. They're raising money, they call for donations. But I don't know if it's a charity. What I'm supporting is the uniform project. The woman who's doing the project dresses in the same dress every day. For three hundred sixty five days with different things around it. So in a way, everything but the dress is an accessory, even pants and tights. Everything is an accessory to that dress. This is basically her every day with the same dress as her black dress. I suck at this. This is what I get for not being prepared . Yeah, this is a model pose right there. 
Funds raised in the program go to the Kontra Foundation. It's for the education of children in India. So far they've raised enough money for one hundred eighteen kids to go to school. If you donate in December, eBay will match your donation up to fifteen thousand dollars for the dollar. So if you donate one hundred and fifty five dollars -- I'm pretty sure -- I mean -- eBay is also gonna donate one hundred and fifty five dollars. It's for a great cause. Kids definitely should go to school and raising money to help someone so they can go to school is just really fantastic, because even though a lot of people are like ugh, school, well you probably have a lot more opportunities now that you have gone to school or that you are going to school, and life is probably going to be a lot easier for you because you went to school. Just saying. It's not a fact. It's just an opinion, but helping these kids go to school will help them be able to achieve more greatness in life. And also decrease world's suck. And hey, who doesn't love decreasing the world's suck. I mean add more awesome to this world. And I think we're probably doing this wrong, but -- that's basically it. She um -- she --
Look what I just found. Thing's monstrous. 
So even if you don't donate, just check it out.
