Bonjour. Hey Twilighters. It's Friday and today is fantastic because I went to Walmart and right in the door, I saw these really crazy like, bottles of soda. I'm like, oh, it's so cute, it's a little ornament. So I'm actually going to make an ornament out of this bottle of soda. It seriously is a bottle of soda, look. Now, woo. . Ah! 
So this week is probably a week that I do not want to remember ever. This is the last week I'll get to see Sana . Hopefully I'll be able to see her either tomorrow or sometime next week before she leaves. I don't want her to go, but let's not talk about goodbyes, because it's never really goodbye. We're always going to be friends and hello Skype. It's going to be sad not hanging out with her all the time. 
So, I went to see New Moon again. It's like, gets better every time I see it. It really cracks me up, because I am just in love with the idea of face punch. Face punch, I love it . Plus the fact that it's blatantly making fun of Hollywood action films. I still think it's fucking hilarious, so I did a face punch trailer just for you guys.  
﻿I have some challenges I need to get out of the way. Both of these challenges are from XXXX. 
Challenge numero uno. XXXX challenged me to go into a bookstore and find as many books as I possibly can on vampires. Well, I haven't been able to go to a bookstore recently, so I went to borders dot com and found several vampire titles. Including The Vampire Diaries, The Vampire Academy, Cirque du Freak, Interview with a Vampire, The Thirst Novels, The Coffin Club, and Dance of the Vampire. Those were just a few I found -- there are so many more out there. And actually, it makes me wonder -- if you write a novel about vampires, is it going to be published because it's popular? 
I think I just figured out how I'm going to get my book published. The subject -- vampires. Ta da! Instant bestseller. No, I don't know, but I just think that there are so many -- it's kind of freaking me out that there are so many vampire novels actually out there and I do like a few. 
Challenge numero dos. XXXX also challenged me to make a attractive face like Rob did in one of his recent interviews. So here goes nothing. 
So also when I went in to go see New Moon again I realized how much I freaking love Michael Sheen, to the point where I just wanted to hug him. He's freaking awesome as Aro and I realized that I didn't put him on my list of things that I liked about New Moon so I wanted to kind of dedicate this blog to his awesomeness. Seriously, when Michael Sheen came onscreen as Aro, I thought I was going to die because he just kind of took over that portion of the movie. His acting was superb and actually, it fit exactly how I imagined Aro in the books. He was so intimidating, yet very, like, welcoming at the same time and I couldn't quite pinpoint why I felt, like, drawn to him and yet repulsed by him at the same time. 
So, um, I thought I'd bring this up right now -- um, fifty book challenge for this year has officially failed for me. I think I read, like, ten and actually I just got done reading this book. It's called Guitar Girl by Sarra Manning. It's really good and I -- I just enjoyed it because it was, like, all about the real story of a teen band and how fame kind of corrupted people and -- basically it's about how people aren't really what they seem to be in real life and people are just out for money and for themselves and it's really good. I just -- I teared up at the end, it was really cute. 
Next I will be reading this book. Whoo hoo, I'm jumping on the bandwagon. No, seriously, I've been meaning to read it for a while, but y'all are saying how awesome it is, so I'm going to read it. Don't know what this is; it's like reading ninja. Whoo, reading ninja. 
Friday, I will see you Twilighters again and, um, Monday, maybe XXXX? Maybe? If not, XXXX, I'll see you on Tuesday -- or before.
