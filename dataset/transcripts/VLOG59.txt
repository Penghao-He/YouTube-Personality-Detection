Hi. I think we can resume. If not then I have no idea. Um, I thought my bedroom's getting like really boring so I decided, hey why not blog in the living room, so that's what I'm doing. I'm blogging in my living room 'cause I'm cool. What the fuck am I doing with my arms? 
Anyway, um, I'm dressed up. I'm in a dress which is like not normal. Dress. Um, I never normally wear dresses, but I'm like going to my sister's baptism soon. I thought it was my mom, but it's not. Um, I'm going to my sister's baptism soon. Um, but yeah, so that's what's happening, yeah, she's getting baptized because she's special. 
Um, I like this cardigan; it's red. I have piano fingers. Ooh, they look like piano keys. They're F'ing cool, but I've scratched this one. There you go. Piano fingers? 
A bracelet. I know who this is from, but I'm not going to wear it. Okay. Go on, Gabe , shite. 
I just and stopped blogging off. Oh my God. Um, I had like loads of people in school asking me why I stopped blogging. So I said blogging? Oh my God. Um, blogging. Ha, we got it right that time. Um, loads of people asking me why I'd stopped so I'm trying to balance on one leg. Not really working. Um, so here I am. 
Um, I basically disappeared because uh, I had a lot on my mind at the time. I had a lot on my mind recently. Um, like me and my friends had a big falling out and then like I had boy trouble -- blah. Um, fuck. I wasn't meant to do that. 
Um, I had a problem with like this guy who was like bugging me and everything and stalking me. So that happened. Sorry I've got a cold. 
Uh, oh, my new phone. . I can't believe you didn't notice that but yeah I got a new phone. It's like um, it's the Samsung Tocco. I have to get it on the menu, click on so you can see the background, but yeah. But yeah, I got a new phone. Um, I got it like last week. 
Yeah, but I have been doing a lot recently. Some girl, right, 'cause, my friend text me, hello one of those. Um, apparently my friend got a new phone and she got the Tocco Light which I'm really pissed off with because it's a newer one than mine and I got mine last week and she got hers this week and she's got the new one which makes me look really . You know, you know girls? 
Um, so yeah. Done my texting. What? I talk to myself. I don't know why I even do this, talking to a camera is really gay. 
I love this song. Yeah. I like that song. It's a good song. Um, hold on, you know the ? I got that on my phone. It goes yeah, yeah, yeah. The one that goes yeah, yeah, yeah. La, la, la. I got that on my phone. Cool and cool. 
Yeah, I found that on the Internet. I was like, whoa. Uh, so I put it on my phone. 'cause my friends, they were like addicted to singing it last week. They're English, the person who I sit next to called Tom, hi Tom. Um, he was like literally, he was like yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm like, oh my God, shut up! We were trying to write an essay and he would not stop singing it. Really, really annoying, a British song. 
So, yeah, uh, I have nothing else to talk about. Oh, on the weekend, um, like me and my cousin, well my cousin came down. We had like a family thingamajig on Friday. Um, and my cousin came down, and, um, we basically, um, he came down with loads of his mates. He came down and we had like a party thing and I got a bit pissed and I had a really bad hangover yesterday.
