Hello, um, so I haven't made a video, like just a random video, in a long time, so I decided that because I am kind of hyper right now, ah, that, ah, I am going to make a video. Okay? So my dad was going through his apartment because his roommate moved out awkwardly and just left all of his stuff and he was going through all this crap that we're not friends and stuff and he came across these Mighty Morphin Power Rangers marbles and he gave them to me and I'm kind of excited about it. It's because its like retro , like seriously, Power Rangers? And they are in marbles? Okay, and I think that it was destined for me to have them cause as you can see, possibly, it says Zach on the top one, like, and that wasn't even the good one, the red one was always the like leader of everything and the black one, um, was just kind of there. Was the black one actually black? I don't remember. Write something in the comments if you remember if the black one was black. I kind of think that he was. Racist? Maybe. 
In school today we were going through, doing the presses and my hand are blue because of it. We were running the presses and I got to print out this, um, Nintendo thingy and it was blue, hence blue ink on my hands still. Anyway, once I was done I went out to one of the computers and started making these, you see right here, the top one is Mr. Ashwave and the bottom one is Blackwidow and um, these are Christmas gifts for my family cause we all came up with superhero names one day and I decided to make them into t shirts and give them, and give them to them for Christmas, obviously. Ha ha, cool, nerd, cool, nerd, gremlin. 
What else do I have to talk about? Oh, I am going to do this live, live to me and not live to you, of course, so here I have got my itchy hat, ha, ha, ha. I just updated them right now, so they should all be correct. So, um, let's just go through and pick one randomly. Okay, let's pick this one. And this one is Cassie out da Box, not "the" Box, "da" box, man, geeze, get in times. 
Well, the last thing that I want to talk about is that I'm in a program that involves like a lot of printing paper and designing things to be put on paper so, um, all the, like, different students print out random things like this and these. So I have, like, lots of paper. I have, like, paper coming up the Ying Yang. Why I have paper in the Ying Yang I don't know. You probably don't want to know even if I did know, so no. So I know this video made absolutely no sense and that there is no flowing movement through it but, um, I though I would just kind of randomly make a video because I haven't made a vlog in a long time. Um, so, um, I will see you guys later, okay? Graaaaaa. Hello YouTube, that was weird, okay.
