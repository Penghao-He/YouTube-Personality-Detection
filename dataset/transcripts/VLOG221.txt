What's happening? What's going down? Uh, I fail at life. I need something to talk about. 
Time to go to the internet, but how? Okay, well, you can find anything on the internet. So, just gonna talk about my life. Uh, boring. I'll make something up, then.  
I could try teleportation. Uh, that worked perfectly. The lighting is so good here. It even matches my shirt. Aah! Okay. So I just moved around. 
You don't have to rain on my parade or anything. Whatever. So. Yeah. Uh huh. In a different mood. Still don't have anything to talk about. 
Oh, yeah. I was gonna make something up. Having the things, YouTube isn't do it. They have something to talk about day after day after day, and I just think of nothing. Usually a creative person, too. Ehhh. Maybe I should just stick with video responsals. No, I promised myself that I was gonna do this, that I was gonna start making videos
Just probably not gonna do that. Err err. But I got a math -- Mac. This -- this here -- this here, that I'm shaking, that is Mac. Aaah! Sorry. 
Um, don't like my hair. Anyway. Um, mmm; what was I saying? Oh, yeah. Since I got a Mac and I got iMovie, it's gonna be easier, like, uch. I don't know. Gonna have to ask my mother how to work this. Yeah. So, I'm gonna make more videos. And not just, like, short little videos, just like, two or three long videos. I mean, three minute long videos. I'm just gonna talk -- talk to you. See how many vees I can get, I guess . 
Next time I'll comb my hair. Uhh. XXXX. 
Bye.
