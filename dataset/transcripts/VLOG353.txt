Happy birthday to you. We didn't have any candles. Holy crap, you're going to be twenty tomorrow. In fact, maybe by the time you watch this video, you're already twenty. That's so weird. 
I don't know, maybe it's because I've known you since we were like nine, but I mean you being twenty is like seriously strange. Happy birthday XXXX, I hope it's the best one ever. I love you -- sweaters in August, ghetto fabulous fake birthday candles and rainbow sprinkled cupcakes. 
So, um, regarding less awesome matters, I've been a lazy bum the past couple of weeks while you've been gone. Basically, I haven't been making videos for like a week -- at least a week, I missed a week of videos and that's bad and that means punishments until I'm ninety, but I have an idea. 
If you can make me some kind of a punishment countdown video or something that had -- um, did you all catch that the random jazz hands? Well, yeah, if you could make me some sort of a, like a punishment countdown video detailing all my punishments, that would be so great, because I am so not organized and, and I will forget. Um, so I need you to remind me what they are. Um, and, and also detail my new ones and then that will catch all the viewers up to date and then they will know what we're talking about when we say punishment. And it will be awesome. 
I'm looking forward to your videos starting again. I've seriously missed you the past couple of weeks and you've probably missed me too because I've been a lazy bum and haven't been updating. 
Oh, you guys, when XXXX gets back I'm in so in trouble, aaaaahh. 
All right XXXX, I guess that's it for this edition of sisterhood 2. 0 and I'm so excited 'cause I'll actually see you tomorrow! 
ï»¿Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday other half of -- two point zero. Happy birthday to you. Thank you, I think I forget something.
