Darwin influenced Freud a lot. Which is true, he did. Um, he was a big influence on Freud's work. Um, and he, Darwin, also believed, you know, the survival of the fittest, and, you know, um, the primal urge of, you know, back -- way back in caveman, kinda sticks with us. And, um, my professor was basically saying that sexual attraction is evolutionary as well, and that, you know, men are attracted to really skinny girls, with a certain hip to waist ratio, um, because, you know, that's their primal instinct, their primal urge. They wanna be with those girls because they're gonna be the healthiest and they're gonna last the longest and blah, blah, blah, for mating ritual things. And that, like, girls are attracted to really muscular guys, because, um, they'll take care of them and survive the longest. 
Um, first of all, that -- my battery is dying, shit, hold on -- okay. Don't mind the dirty laundry behind me. That, you know, it's primal instinct because guys who are muscular are going to take care of them more and survive the best and be able to fight off those saber tooth tigers et cetera. 
Well, , and you know, it's a good theory, um, however I find a lot of flaws in it. Um, first off, the flaws I find are that a, if a guy was going to be attracted to the girl who was going to last the longest, like live the longest, and be able to bear him children, I don't think he would be attracted to the really skinny girls. I mean, I -- I have nothing against really skinny girls, um, -- I have friends who are really skinny -- but I think that, you know, as far as bearing children, they -- wouldn't they want someone with a little bit more meat and hip and being able to, you know, bear that child? And also, as far as live the longest, back then, like way, way, way, way back in history, fatter -- I mean, they didn't have all the signs of cardio problems and stuff -- so fatter seemed healthier because you weren't starving. You weren't sickly. You weren't going to, you know, just die from starvation, or, you know, be able to be freezing in the winter. You'd have more meat on you to keep you warm. 
So I find a flaw in that, because I don't think that that would be, you know, the case. And also, I think it's kind of sexist, in a way, because who says that girls have to be attracted to the muscular guys, to take care of them. Um, I mean, I was perfectly fine without a guy. I don't need a guy to take care of me. Um, I chose the guy I love because I love him, and we're good companions, and we take care of each other. So I don't need some muscular guy to ward off saber toothed tigers, no. Give me Arabia, and I'll fence off the saber toothed tiger. I fence, well, I used to, but I want to continue. 
So, I mean, seriously -- I just think that it's ridiculous, personally. And I think attraction, as far as mass attraction, like what we're told to think is attractive, is fed to us by the media. By TV shows, music, posters, um, yeah, it's just fed to us. And we're told what is socially acceptable from early on. Even, like, little kids, when you tell them bed time stories, the beautiful princess was thin, tall, long blond hair, golden hair, and blue eyes. Be passionate and hyped up about this, because, like, seriously, it is just fed to us through society, not just the media, but society in general and our culture. In the United States, and the world today, because of mass communications and, just everything, story books, Disney movies, you know, everything tells us to like a certain type of person. 
True beauty and true love and attraction is just in the eye of the beholder. I've never liked muscular men. I've always thought muscles were kinda gross. I mean, not like normal muscles, but I mean like, the big muscles, six packs, you know, like the ripped guys. I always thought that just looked unnatural and just gross. There are also a lot of guys who are attracted to BBW's and are kind of in the closet about it. And also, back to the primal instinct thing, if it was solely attraction on primal urge of mating rituals, then why are there so many people who are homosexual? That is just, like, love and attraction that is not, you know, a primal urge, um, so yeah, it's not just a primal mating ritual. Okay. 
So I believe in soulmates, and I believe in reincarnation, and I believe we have many lives. So I believe that people that we are attracted to, it's because we are attracted to their soul. Because, either we knew them in another life, or we knew them in heaven, or we wanted to know them. So I think -- it's just a beautiful and romantic thing that we're connected to certain people, um, and it's more in depth. Um, I also think that's why we're connected to certain animals more, like certain pets, because maybe we knew them in another life, maybe they were human before. Um, I just -- I don't know. I have a very Pollyanna view on the world so, -- I've been told -- I don't know, maybe you shouldn't listen to me, but I'm a very hopeless romantic, philosophical, everything is fantasy and beauty, and whatever. But that's just how I am, and it's just what I believe, um, I'm not really scientific, but it's just a feeling that's inside me, you know, but, um, yeah. 
And another thing I noticed is, erm, a lot of people are attracted to people of the same body type. I know at least it's from -- it's that way for me. I've dated a couple of really skinny guys, and I never liked dating guys who are skinnier or smaller than me. That always made me feel so huge and it just -- it made me feel very uncomfortable, and it was just my own self esteem issue. So when looking for a guy, I would look for a guy who was the same, a little smaller, or bigger than me, but not really skinny, because I just -- I would feel really like a giant if I was around a really skinny guy, and no girl wants to feel like that. But again, that's also a societal thing. Girls can't be bigger than their guys, another society pushed thing. So, yeah, I think attraction -- sexual attraction is, you know, on a whole, in the eye of the beholder, and everybody finds someone else attractive. And also, it's also society, what they push you to find attractive, and what you grow up learning is attractive. 
But one of my favorite quotes is, I don't love you because I think you're attractive, I think you're attractive because I love you. And, it's so true. My husband will always be attractive to me, because I love him, and I'm sure it's on the other end. At least, he's told me that. So I'll leave you with that quote. Thanks. Bye. Happy Monday.
