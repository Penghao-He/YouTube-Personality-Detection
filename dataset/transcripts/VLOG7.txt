Hey you guys, um, I decided for this video I would be holding a Christmas ball. I just took it off my tree because it broke and, um, it's kinda plastic, a bit stupid, but I just thought since Christmas is coming up soon, that I'd, you know, my video that's, uh -- that's my attempt. 
All right, let's start off this with, um, a little recap. Um, I haven't made a video, um, in a while, so I guess this is time to you just talk a bit more about what happened last week and the week before last, and my views on it. 
Sadly, a lot of really good acts have actually been booted off X Factor, um, names such as Lucie Jones; Lloyd Daniels; add Danyl Johnson; all really good contestants, but I don't really think they made the cut. And the finalists now are the ones who really deserve to be in there, and are the ones that are definitely the best. But I was still very sad to see those three go. Um, when I found out that John and Edward, , um, were kicked off, I was really happy, because every second when I saw them perform, I died a little inside. Isn't that sad? 
Last week, after watching Lady Gaga perform Bad Romance in her awesome devil costume and starting off in a bath that apparently was from Simon Cowell, I, uh, placed my vote for Oli. I am about to place my vote this week for Oli Myers. 
Thank you for calling The X Factor. and be with you. 
Woow! Go Myers! All right, let's talk a little bit about this week, because that's probably the most important thing at the moment. Um, I sadly don't have my TV yet. Um, actually, . That's for my TV when it comes. It should have come a couple of weeks ago, but it still hasn't come. Damn. Can't wait. 
And, um, this is my tree and our stockings -- and I kinda went off the point, but anyway. Um, yeah. So basically, uh, I watched a couple of performances on the ITV Channel Four for X Factor, and, um, I was really disappointed. Last week was amazing. All the acts did brilliantly; they sang really well; I was -- wanted them all to stay in, 'cause they all did so fabulously. But this time it was terrible. They did just terrible. So, yeah, Stacey was kicked out, big deal -- she did terrible. I liked her -- her first audition and she went downhill from there. She just wasn't that great. I don't like her personality. It's too corky and funny and cute and really, really hyper. It's like she's always, constantly fueled with coffee and caffeine and whatever other stimulants I could -- I could think off, but I can't. Anyway, it's like she had a tube in her puffing , and she's always so hyper it pissed me off. So I'm so glad she got kicked off. Um, but yeah, I think Oli's going to win, I'm sorry. Both Oli and Joe have got a lot of support. However, Joe is younger, less experienced, while Oli's older, smarter, cooler, better and just way more appealing than any of the other competitors since the whole show started. Um, so I'm really hoping he wins. 
All right, now it's your time to get video responding and commenting on this video. Please tell me what you think, um, about this week's, uh, shows, last week's shows, whatever. Who you want to see win the X Factor and who do you think, um, would be, like, the best record producing artist out of all the expected contestants. Because already, Lucie Jones and Lloyd Daniels and John and Edward have already -- still are pretty famous, even though they already got kicked off, which was, um, inevitable, because liked them. 
Anway --
