Good afternoon. It's Saturday August twenty ninth. My name is XXXX. My YouTube name is XXXX and I'm broadcasting to you from Perth, West Australia. This week on the XXXX. We'll be describing our favorite places of art. All the while participating and accepting one of the challenges. I'm going to accept a challenge of describing my painting without using a particular word. My favorite piece of artwork is a painting by a local west Australian artist called Ellen Norton. And the painting is called Man Receiving Insights. The painting is a very simple painting. There are only three elements. There's a man, a dog and the setting. Norton has painted the setting as a typical Australian beach from the north of our suburbs. From the north of our country. So in the immediate foreground we've got the red dirt of our out back and beyond that we've got the yellow sand of our beaches, a crystallized blue waters, typical of our oceans, and above that, our brilliant blue skies. And now I'm going to attempt to act out for you, the other two elements, the dog and the man. So, first of all, we'll start with the dog. Now the dog is painted on the left of the painting, about the middle and he's sitting on the bench. He's down on all four hunches. He's got a long mouth. And I think this Norton has painted this long mouth because it sort of retains a kind of an embarrassing sort of look. And then the only other element of the painting is the man. Now Norton's painted him with a white fluffy cap because you've got to depict yourself in these as suburban and Norton has painted this man with his back to us and he's doing this. That's right. He's leaping for joy. Now, Norton's included a little ticket here. She's painted the man nude. So it's these elements that I really find attractive about this painting. It's the simpleness of the construction. It's the hanged dog, embarrassed dog. And it's the man who's naked. He's leaping for joy. He's received insight. He's experienced a eureka moment. I think that Norton has so effectively planted this that the metaphor that I interested was that like how casting aside his clothes, the man's realized that he's going to cast aside your inhibitions. You can experience joy and eureka moments. So, I hope you've enjoyed my description. I hope that you might be able to find a link to the painting somewhere on the . Please check out my channel. Bye.
